university students have come to the japanese alps during new year's for a skiing vacation among them are takashi iijima  his girlfriend machiko takeno  and her brother nakada  the other members of the group are their friends gen and kaji exhilarated by the mountain views gen and kaji get a little carried away and decide to ski way on ahead of the others takashi warns them that the way down the mountain is a lot more difficult than it looks but the other two decide to go ahead anyway sure enough when takashi nakata and machiko return to their lodge the innkeeper has seen no sign of the other two because the weather has taken a sudden downturn the mountain is about to get hit by a blizzard fortunately there is another shelter down the mountain where a sixth member of the group machiko's elder brother should be waiting for them already with a little luck gen and kaji should have been able to reach it the caretaker tries to telephone the remote cabin but nobody answers he tries to hide his concern but nobody's fooled while takashi takes over trying to ring the cabin machiko stares out the window into the deepening storm she catches sight of a shadowy figure shambling toward the lodge it's really a furclad young woman named chika  who lives in a remote village somewhere deep in the mountains chika is none too pleased to see so many visitors in the lodge since the people of her village shun all contact with outsiders however the night is so brutal that she has little choice but to join them if she wants to stay warm even now there is no response from the cabin and the little group is horrified to hear the sound of an avalanche thundering down a nearby slope the lodge telephone starts ringing it's the cabin where gen and kaji are machiko runs to the phone but no sooner has she put it up to her ear when she throws it back down again in horror through the earpiece comes the sound of screams followed by a single gun shot there is a moment of silence takashi picks up the receiver he hears another agonized scream and the line goes dead chika puts her furs back on and slips away unnoticed by the others the next day as soon as the weather clears a rescue party goes off to find gen and kaji gen is found dead on the cabin floor kaji's body has been dragged out into the snow their injuries suggest they were attacked by something far stronger than a man of the elder takeno though there is no sign takashi and nakata find strange tufts of hair around the cabin as though whatever had left them was absurdly large but most disturbing of all are the enormous bare footprints leading off into the snow the search team splits up with one group bringing the dead men back to the lodge and the other continuing the search for takeno by nightfall there is still no sign of takeno and the leader of the rescue team informs the others that they'll have to return to tkyo until the spring thaw once the snow on the mountains have thawed enough for a proper search to be mounted takashi and machiko return to the alps with professor koizumi  and his expedition there is little hope of takeno having survived a fact which machiko seems to have come to terms with but if there is some clue what happened to him and the others takashi is determined to find it determining takeno's fate though is almost incidental to koizumi's intentions the main focus of the expedition is to find out if there's a previously unknown bipedal primate lurking in the area when the party arrives at an inn machiko is distracted by a monkey in a cage as she stops to feed it some treats the shifty little man who seems to own the animal turns to the innkeeper and asks him who the koizumi expedition might be the innkeeper explains that this is a famous zoologist from the city who will be spending some time in the area as soon as the innkeeper's back is turned the little man sneaks out of the room and goes to find his boss his boss is ba  an animal broker of lessthansterling reputation his job is to capture animals for circuses and he's heard stories of one animal in particular that account for his presence here when his lackey tells him a university scientist has come with a fully equipped expedition ba has no trouble guessing what he's looking for ba had thought he had the area to himself but there may be an upside to koizumi's competition ba and his men can follow the expedition surreptitiously make use of koizumi's knowledge of the local wildlife and sneak in ahead of him when they start getting close to their target little does ba know that he's not the only one following koizumi's progress as the expedition gets further into the mountains a whitebearded old man and his oddly shaped sidekick watch them warily late one night as the expedition tries to get some sleep after the day's misfortunes a very large shadow falls across machiko's tent a face appears at the tent window it's the snowman the creature reaches into the tent and touches machiko's face causing her to wake up and scream the snowman runs off into the forest while takashi chases after him takashi loses his way and takes a bad fall as he stumbles back to the campfire that he believes marks the expedition site he's astonished to find himself surrounded by ba and his cronies ba's men give takashi a beating and casually toss him into a lethally deep ravine takashi is found at the bottom of the cliff by none other than chika the girl who'd appeared and disappeared so mysteriously during the snowstorm chika brings him back to her village a place so isolated that it's had little or no contact with the outside world for generations that the population has become inbred and disfigured there she tends to his wounds as he regains consciousness she is the granddaughter of the whitebearded old village chief when the village finds out chika has brought someone from civilization into their midst they become furious but the chief pretending to be reasonable sends chika out to bring an offering of game to the snowman who the villagers worship's as a deity while he confers with the others she takes her grandfather at his word and leaves takashi alone with the angry crowd they bind him gag him and hang him off a cliff to be eaten by the vultures when chika gets back she's horrified to find takashi gone when she confronts her grandfather the old man castigates her both for defying tradition and for challenging his authority he also beats her viciously with a stick chika goes off on her own up the mountain to nurse her injuries sitting alone on a rocky path she runs into ba and his henchman she mistakes them from members of koizumi's party out looking for takashi ba seizes the opportunity to try to worm his way into the girl's trust he trades her a shiny silver ring for some information on where the snowman can be found the gift of the ring persuades her and chika marks the spot for ba by throwing a stone across the valley meanwhile the snowman is on his way back to its cave with a freshly killed deer over his shoulder when he sees a curious thing a human hanging off a cliff by a rope so the beast calmly puts down the deer pulls takashi back up unties his hands shoulders the deer again and walks off without a second glance ba and his men lug their traps and equipment up the mountain to the creature's lair but when they get there they make an astonishing discovery there's a juvenile snowman playing by the cave entrance ba's eyes light up with fiendish inspiration they'll trap the young snowman and use it as bait to capture the adult the snowman comes back a little while later and is horrified to find the cave empty as he searches frantically for the little creature ba's men remove the gag from the juvenile's mouth its cries of terror bring the snowman storming back out of the cave a heavy net falls on it trapping the creature and ba's men use chloroform to knock him out back in the village chika is still being punished for breaking the rules and in the course of her punishment her grandfather finds the ring chika admits that she's told the outsiders about the snowman's lair the old man and the other villagers arrive at the cave just in time to see ba preparing the unconscious beast for transport when the old chief tries to intervene ba shoots him terrified the remaining villagers can do little more than jeer impotently and throw stones as the outsiders drag the snowman away the young creature has managed to slip out of his bonds and run away ba is at first too excited by capturing the adult creature and later too busy fending off the locals to notice that the little beast has escaped but the young creature has no intention of running away when the truck carrying the snowman starts off down the mountain the juvenile springs onto the platform and works at undoing the ropes ba finds himself the last surviving human as the adult creature begins to break his way out of the cage in the chaos that results ba ends up killing the little snowman the adult snowman grabs ba and throws him to a gruesome death with his offspring dead the snowman enraged and full of grief runs back to the village and destroys it takashi makes it back to the camp and tells his story to his companions the snowman is then heard approaching their camp the beast grabs michiko while she's adding logs to the fire the next day the expedition spots smoke in the distance they find the smoldering remnants of the village and chika chika tells them about what happened and takashi asks her where the snowman's cave is she then leads them to the cave there they find the bones of takeno as well as the fragments of his journal according to the last fragmentary journal entries takeno had been tracking the creature when he was caught in an avalanche the snowman had actually tried to save takeno's life giving the injured man food and shelter going further into the cave the party finds a large pile of bones  snowman bones koizumi finds poisonous amanita muscaria mushrooms growing near the bones and speculates that eating these mushrooms may have killed off the snowman population the creature storms in with machiko over his shoulder they chase the beast further into the cave until it stops by a pit of boiling sulfur chika comes to the rescue attacking the snowman with her knife she distracts the creature enough that takashi is able to get a clear shot at it the mortally wounded snowman grabs chika and drags her down with him as he plunges into the sulfur pool to certain death\",\n",

       " \"vikas sagar  would go anywhere for a scoop risk his life and limb to get an exclusive story that nobody else can it is for this precise reason vikas is a familiar face watched by six million viewer's weeknights on aaj tak news channel ambitious popular and professional vikas is considered one of the most promising journalists in the business it is also the reason uwais hussain  a senior producer at the controversial istanbul based al johara widely criticized as the mouthpiece of terrorists or as their network of choice makes him an offer to head the channel's proposed indian bureau for an outrageous salary and other perks it is an offer he almost can't refuse because of the channel's controversial profile which ensures that it is seen by everyone globally including the white house it certainly would take vikas's career to another level not only does he become the highest paid journalist in india but also puts him on an international platform but there is one condition that the head hunters from al johara insist he must join asap and then fly to istanbul for a three month orientation programme their offer couldn't have come at a better time for vikas who's undergoing a painful divorce with wife anjali  an equally feisty journalist whose desire to have a baby leads to their separation because her husband wants her to wait a little longer and seems to be in no mood to start a family while al johara dangles the temptation of kickstarting their india operations vikas accepts the offer largely to mend his broken heart but little does vikas know that his life is about to change when he takes the flight to istanbul on a three month orientation program at the channel's headquarters while al johara is one of the most viewed channels in the world its reputation has been largely built as the mouthpiece of a dreaded terrorist abu nazir who is on the most wanted lists of both the interpol and fbi is vociferous in his threat to wage war against several countries including india a threat he usually delivers via a videotape to al johara on the flight vikas finds himself seated next to a stunningly beautiful copassenger who hates flying lisa lobo  is headed for istanbul to attend a medical convention or so she claims in her obvious discomfort she turns to an amused vikas for moral support and distraction from the reality of being airborne it is a budding friendship that's grounded the moment the flight lands and lisa disappears at the airport once in istanbul vikas's initial impression of al johara is in sharp contrast to its notorious reputation especially when he meets the charismatic ghazni  who has business interests all over the world but whose obsession these days is al johara as an instrument to shape world events there is only one word of caution to vikas and that's never ever to venture onto the th floor known as the catacomb as part of his orientation vikas gets handson experience in the al johara newsroom where he watches ghastly and exclusive news reports of terrorism he learns more about abu nazir who is described as a oneman organization whose existence revolves around a single person vikas is told that it is extremely difficult to find out any details about his private life and his habits because such information would help the secret services who are looking for him abu nazir is cautious to the point of paranoia reeling under the impact of the reality bytes at work vikas's only relief is his flirtatious encounters with lisa and the lively company of soldierturned journalist owais hussain who is looking forward to quitting his job and settling down with his irish girlfriend but on an assignment to cover kidnapped journalists in one of abu nazir's terrorist camps in afghanistan vikas is shocked when abu nazir's brother khalil  brutally executes owais hussain just before a un peacekeeping force mounts a rescue operation reeling at this close encounter with terrorism and watching a brutal killing vikas returns to istanbul in a daze and is approached by a former turkish commando rizwan khan  who hints that no senior employee has ever quit al johara and rattles off a list of al

forrester's minor role that led to his death he also explains how the subsequent deaths of his parents soon after affected him and led to his becoming a recluse as part of jamal's tutelage forrester

parallels with forrester's piece published in  and brings jamal up on plagiarism charges jamal must either admit forrester's influence on his work or prove he had forrester's permission to use his

has done and asks him to defend him but forrester is angry at jamal for breaking his promise and refuses jamal then accuses forrester of being scared and selfish for not helping him jamal is then told by the school that they value his contributions in basketball and agree that they will drop the plagiarism charges if he wins them the state championship jamal comes to realize his intellectual gifts

figure of fun evan adams iii decides however that she is ripe for exploitation as the average american girl and hires her to do a series of advertisements for adams soap as she pursues what is becoming a lucrative career relations between her and peter sheppard become strained at the same time adams is showing an increasing interest in her the situation reaches a crisis when gladys breaks a date with sheppard in order to attend what adams says is a business conference to discuss a crosscountry publicity tour the conference turns out to be an attempted seduction as adams reaches to embrace gladys she accidentally or intentionally spills a full glass of champagne down the back of adams neck breaking the spell gladys says i don't mind the way you're acting exactly what i mind is the way you give the idea you're sort of entitled maybe i am says adams oh sure if you want to make it into a sort of business proposition that's what you're doing isn't it asks adams gladys says the

rides the dust cloud all the way through the air and finally stops to determine where he is a question mark appearing over his head he opens a door in the cloud only to see that he is in midair and sheepishly closes the door as the cloud disperses and then changes his question mark of surprise to an exclamation point before the inexorable pull of gravity takes effect  the pair pull up onto opposite outcroppings and wile e attempts to polevault from his to his opponent's but this causes the end of his outcropping to crumble and the coyote to fall down seeing his impending humiliation approaching wile e attempts to make the best of it by climbing up the pole however he keeps falling back to the bottom of it eventually the pole turns around so fast that it whirs like a propeller and then grinds against a cliffside all the way down to the part wile e is holding when it finally stops rotating the coyote then pulls himself onto the narrow bar left of the pole and accepts his fate  in a gag that sees four attempts in this cartoon wile e sits on a rocket and lights the fuse aiming towards the road runner on the opposite site of the chasm  the first attempt fails when the fuel and nosecone launch out of the rocket leaving wile e sitting on an empty hull the hull crunches down and then wile falls annoyed to the canyon floor  as the road runner burns rubber on the ground roads wile e is pulling back on a falling safe attached to a rope and pulley eventually however the weight overcomes him and the coyote is pulled through the pulley removing all of his chest fur and then down onto a seesaw as the safe lands next to him wile then slides off the rock face to fall into the canyon a fourth time and is then smashed by the safe leaving the coyote's torso thin and flat  the second attempt at the rocket is foiled when the rocket falls out of its aim towards the road runner and points directly downwards before it fires leading to an extraspeedy fifth fall  now ross animates a sequence in which wile e sticks a firecracker into the center hole of a frisbee  and throws it at his nemesis but before he releases the disc the firecracker drops out of the hole and sizzles at wile e's foot the coyote doesn't notice until he puts his foot down on the firework and instinctively pulls it away just before it explodes leaving him dazed but apparently unhurt wile then walks away like charlie chaplin revealing behind him that his tail is on fire unknown to him until he passes the horizon and he yelps in pain  on his third attempt with the rocket he lights the fuse but it burns quickly and fires successfully out from under him before he could get ready and leaves wile floating in midair with a cloud of dust blocking his view below unable to see what is below him wile pokes his foot through the cloud and consequently suffers gravity for the sixth time as he holds up a sign stating goodbye and then flipping to again   to get the bird to stick wile leaves out a sheet of acme giant fly paper in the road and sits down on a rock laughing at his genius he hears a braking noise assumes the road runner has been caught and leaps out to catch him but instead of the road runner he has caught an actual giant fly the fly is very unhappy about being stuck on the paper and thus wraps the coyote with it who tiptoes away from the scene  on his final attempt at the skyrocket wile e accidentally ignites his tail instead of the fuse and detects his mistake and leaps up in pain only to smash his head on another outcropping fortunately this causes him to return to the rocket and to light the fuse with his tail and after it takes off is struggling briefly to get control then puts out the fire on his tail unfortunately the rocket is off target and it bores through the cliff under the road runner who allows the coyote to be humiliated privately the rocket finally explodes blackening the coyote and throwing him back into the air displeased wile e holds up a yellow sign asking how did i ever get into this line of work before falling for a seventh time  a new plan is formulated where wile e attempts to blow up the road runner by pelting explosive tennis balls at him the first ball seamlessly blows up a cactus with no issues  and the coyote is eager to try them at work as luck would have it the road runner is heard and wile is quick to lob another ball at him but just misses and the ball then drops onto the arm of a cactus which throws it directly back to its owner a little agitated the coyote returns the ball and this time it is caught by power lines and slung back out of wile e's reach the ball pops directly back into its original slot in the box of balls as wile e arrives on the scene and takes stock sensing the coming explosions wile e holds up a pair of signs for sale one used tennis racket and cheap before  a gigantic explosion occurs  the whole cartoon however is best known for its ending gag wile e coyote is chasing the road runner through a series of pipelines which causes both of them to emerge in a greatly shrunken state upon discovering their situation they agree to reenter the pipeline and be transformed back into full size the road runner emerges at normal size but wile is still in small size when he comes out upon discovering this turn of fortune the road runner stops and allows his rival to catch him the coyote doesn't notice anything until he steps over his opponent's feet and rushes back to finally catch the road runner the coyote is ecstatic and pulls out his knife and fork to eat his opponentuntil he stares more closely at the bird's huge legs which are twice as tall as he is and looks up to see he is massively outgunned the road runner gives an amplified beepbeep causing wile to drop his utensils in shock he can only hold up signs to the audience stating okay wise guys you always wanted me to catch him  and now what do i do well that's all folks\",\n",

taken refuge in the cellar and sure enough when sam goes into the basement he is eaten by the bizarre monstrosity barb suffers the same fate when she goes down to see what happened to sam the creature corners her and viciously bites off her face aunt millie is awakened by screaming but she attributes it to the horror movie that charles is watching on tv in his room charles is obsessed with magic monsters and scaring people when aunt millie returns to call charles to breakfast he surprises her by wearing a scary mask and costume and setting off flash powder when she opens the door pete

has plans to have lunch with her mother bunny  who is planning an extravagant vegetarian lunch for a small group of friends uncle herb who is a psychologist is interested in talking with charles about

real life charles seems to be well grounded however understanding that monsters are not real uncle herb falls asleep in the living room and aunt millie heads over to her mother's house to help set up the luncheon an electrician arrives to investigate a problem with the circuit breaker box in the basement of the house and charles sees an opportunity to scare somebody slipping on his mask he creeps down into the basement which is flooded with several inches of water but he discovers something strange the basement is swarming with small tadpolelike creatures the size of small fish charles follows them silently until he finds the electrician's body in a corner with hundreds of the smaller creatures feasting on it the creatures are all of varying sizes from the small fishsized tadpoles to armsized worms and there is a huge one presumably the original that has developed three different heads the smaller ones seem to be spawn given off by the adult monster each with the potential to grow into a full sized threat the creatures have no eyes and charles discovers they are sensitive to sound in which their open mouths filled with hundreds of sharp teeth seem to be their receiver of sounds since they apparently do not have ears either the large threeheaded creature almost eats him when he snaps his fingers and he is only able to distract it by tossing his flashlight into a far corner and allowing it to go after the noise adding to the horror he sees barb's disembodied head lying on the cement floor partially consumed by spawn and realizes that the creatures have killed his parents charles stands motionless against a basement wall unable to move in fear of being discovered by the alien creatures meanwhile ellen and frankie arrive for the study session in a flurry of excitement they have discovered one of the creatures dead on the way over to the house and they've brought along its body to dissect in an attempt to understand what it is frankie hypothesizes that the creature could be from outer space but pete is hostile to that idea and dismisses it as ignorance ellen reminds pete that to make suppositions scientists must have some imagination at bunny's house millie arrives and helps her set up for her guests bunny is unaware that the spawn have reached the house and are lurking in her kitchen one of them gets into her food processor tainting the vegetable sauce she is making when her guests arrive all of them older ladies they are horrified when they taste the sauce with the dead spawn in it and the armsized creatures suddenly come at them from all angles biting at fingers and toes latching onto their legs and arms like small leeches the women fight back and smash and kill a number of the creatures all of them barely escaping with their lives in millie's car back at the house pete ellen and frankie seek out uncle herb to get his opinion on the strange creature they've found they find herb's body in the living room with hundreds of spawn eating him from the inside out the threeheaded adult creature confronts them in the hallway and they run upstairs to charles's bedroom charles who understands that the creature will chase after them because of the noise they are making distracts it with a radio which it eats before the creature can find charles and kill him the doorbell ringskathy has finally arrived at the house pete and the others try to warn her from an upstairs window but she doesn't hear them and goes into the house anyway the monster nearly grabs her in the hallway outside charles' bedroom but she escapes its huge mouth desperate to summon help the teens devise a plan they will make a dash for pete's bedroom where there is a telephone and they'll call for help but the monster ambushes them in the hallway pete runs to another room frankie and kathy run upstairs to the attic while ellen stays in charles' bedroom and slams the door the creature attracted by her shouting knocks the door down and rushes at her before ellen can escape out the window the monster bites her head off and her headless body falls out into the front yard of the house pete climbs out onto the roof and sees ellen's body on the ground below he also notices his parents car still in the garage meaning they never left kathy and frankie see ellen from the attic window too and pete eventually climbs in through the small opening he is in shock and is delirious telling them ellen's really scared when he tries to open the barricaded door frankie tries to stop him but pete becomes unhinged fighting with frankie and screaming for ellen frankie knocks him unconscious but it's too late his shouting attracts the creature fortunately charles has concocted a plan rushing to his bedroom he assembles a hollow head full of flash powder embedding a frayed electrical cord in the explosive material as the creature advances on frankie and kathy kathy is hysterical and screaming charles rushes up the stairs and tells them to be quiet then he baits the creature with the fake head at first it refuses to eat it until charles gets the idea to scream the monster immediately devours the head with the dangling power cord hanging just outside its mouth using extension cords charles lures the creature closer and closer until he is close enough to an electrical outlet to plug it in however one of the armsized spawn creatures lands on his right shoulder from the above rafter and begins biting into him charles is forced to use a screwdriver to stab at the spawn attached to his shoulder until the threeheaded mother spawn approaches and inadvertently eats the wounded spawn creature from charles' shoulder thus freeing him charles manages to get at the extension cord and plugs it into an outlet and the threeheaded spawn creature instantly explodes in a gory shower of alien blood and body parts all over the attic interior the threat no longer a secret a massive hunt for the spawn has been mobilized at the house and the surrounding areas as dozens of townspeople converge on the area aunt millie arrives back at the house and cares for the wounded and shaken pete and charles as best she can while policemen and volunteers scour the surrounding woods and bushes for spawn which they stun with cattle prods or stab with shovels picks and axes the creatures are dumped onto various bonfires that the locals set and are disposed of including the remains of the threeheaded eightfoot mother spawn frankie and kathy are also shaken but alive and are taken away in an ambulance in the final scene several hours later night falls the house now deserted except for a posted patrolman seems to have been cleared of all the aliensthat is until the patrolman hears a rumbling in the ground it seems as if an earthquake is hitting until the entire hillside next to the house erupts with the head of a gigantic spawn even larger than the house itself\",\n",

holistically the plot contains two parallel story lines a professionalmisconduct challenge brought against praetorius by his more conventional colleague dr rodney elwell  who dislikes praetorius's unorthodox but effective methods and the struggle of a distressed young woman named deborah higgins  who falls in love with praetorius while dealing with an outofwedlock pregnancy the film also highlights praetorius's close friend and confidant physics professor lyonel barker  who plays bass viol in the studentfaculty orchestra conducted by praetorius  at the start of the film elwell has hired a detective to investigate praetorius a housemaid  who once worked for praetorius reacts visibly when elwell asks her about praetorius's mysterious friend mr shunderson who rarely leaves praetorius's side and has a deep intuitive understanding of human and animal nature elwell's detective discovers that shunderson was once tried for murder and elwell calls for a misconduct hearing against praetorius at the hearing praetorius explains that he started his career in a small town by opening a butcher shop as a front for his undeclared medical practice because the people of the town didn't trust doctors elwell tries to discredit praetorius's methods but praetorius defends his use of faith in healing describing how he was forced to leave town after his maid discovered his medical degree praetorius refuses to answer questions about shunderson but shunderson explains that he served  years in prison for the alleged death of a man who had tried to murder him then somehow survived being hanged after actually murdering the man who had gone into hiding during the first trial when he woke up he was lying on a table in front of praetorius who was at that time a medical student examining what he believed was a corpse praetorius kept shunderson's survival a secret and shunderson became praetorius's devoted friend after this story is told the chairman concludes the hearing in praetorius's favor and elwell walks away alone and discredited  meanwhile deborah enters praetorius's life displaying signs of emotional distress after she faints during a lecture praetorius examines her and informs her that she's pregnant upset by this news mrs higgins admits that she's not really married the unborn child's father is dead and knowing about her condition would be too much for her own father to bear in a hallway near praetorius's office she shoots herself after successfully operating on deborah praetorius tries to calm her by telling her there was a mistake in her pregnancy test but she has fallen in love with him and becomes upset at her own embarrassing behavior she runs away from the clinic forcing him to find her so he can tell her she really is pregnant praetorius and shunderson drive out to where deborah and her father arthur live a farm owned by arthur's brother john deborah and praetorius hide deborah's shooting incident from her father who is a failure in life and lives unhappily as a dependent of his stingy brother deborah is his only pride in life which might become intolerable for him with a baby to take care of and his daughter's reputation ruined while showing praetorius the farm deborah admits her love for him she also wonders why he is visiting and begins to suspect that he is attracted to her after she seductively interrogates him they share a passionate kiss they soon get married and arthur comes to live with them a few weeks later deborah suggests to noah that she may be pregnant and he admits that she was pregnant all along she ruefully concludes that he married her out of pity but he convinces her that he really did fall in love with her for some reason praetorius's misconduct hearing was scheduled for the same time as the studentfaculty orchestra's concert after the hearing and praetorius' acquittal the film ends with deborah shunderson and barker in the audience watching praetorius conduct the orchestra in the finale of brahms's academic festival overture  gaudeamus igitur    according to a review at the films de france website the movie has a number of political overtones the review says the film is a reaction to mankiewiczs own experiences during the communist witch hunts of the late s early s which were initiated by senator joseph mccarthy whilst president of the directors guild mankiewicz was openly attacked by cecil b demille a once great filmmaker and hardline conservative for his unwillingness to support the anticommunist campaign like many of his fellow directors and screenwriters mankiewicz was a liberal who refused to denounce others working in hollywood who had communist sympathies the film's investigative trial has parallels to the congressional hearings by anticommunist crusaders and just as some refused to name names in such hearings the lead character played by cary grant declines to clear his own name by revealing the private business of another person in this case a convicted murderer the review said that although the movie is meant as a cautionary tale about the dangers of witch hunts it deals with many other issues including the pregnancy of a single woman the corrosive effect of unfettered capitalism the human cost of the korean war among others\",\n",

the men were partisan infiltrators and his only link to his daughter maritza major petrovich's principal worry is an impending assault by the wehrmacht the germans are marshaling their forces nearby

millions of gallons of water being enough to destroy the bridge a nighttime air drop is arranged to replace force 's lost supplies but lescovar sabotages the drop by calling in german planes maritza

even though lescovar's uniform made him out to be a corporal mallory had noticed a map showing that their train passes within a halfmile of the dam  a fact lescovar neglected to bring up though lescovar denies treachery mallory is convinced and barnsby kills him jumping the train near the dam the team splits up miller and weaver set off diversionary explosives while mallory and barnsby sneak into the dam weaver runs into capt drazak in the woods and kills him after a knife fight mallory and barnsby set their charges within the dam but realize that they are out of time with the german

difficult economically strained family life in a lowerclass workers' complex in industrial nottingham without a job colin indulges in petty crime in the company of his best friend mike  meanwhile at home his father's long years of toil in a local factory have resulted in a terminal illness for which his father refuses treatment colin is angered by the callousness of his mother  who he knows already has a fancy man and who colin finds has neglected to give his father a herbal concoction for pain and as colin believes brings about his father's death colin rebels by refusing a job offered to him at his father's factory and watches with disdain as his mother spends the five hundred pounds in insurance money the company pays her on clothes a television and new furniture when his mother's lover moves into the house and after an argument when his mother tells him to leave colin and mike take to the streets colin uses his portion of the insurance money to treat mike and two girls they meet to an outing in skegness where colin falls in love with his date audrey  and confesses to her that she is the first woman he's ever slept with she eventually extracts a halfhearted promise from colin that he might look for work implying his feelings for her are such that marriage is a possibility but one night while prowling the streets of nottingham with mike the two spot an open window at the back of a building it's a bakery with nothing much to steal but the cashbox which contains about seventy pounds mike is all for another outing to skegness with the girls but colin is more cautious and hides the money in a drainpipe outside his prefab house soon the police come calling accusing colin of the robbery he tells the surly detective  he has no knowledge of the crime the detective produces a search warrant on a subsequent visit but can find nothing finally frustrated and angry he returns to say he'll be watching colin as the two stand at colin's front door in the rain the torrent of water pouring down the drainpipe dislodges the money which washes out around colin's feet this backstory is interspersed in flashbacks with colin's presenttime experiences at ruxton towers where he must contend with the jealousy of his fellow inmates over the favouritism shown to him by the governor especially when the governor decides not to discipline colin as he does the others over a dininghall riot because of ruxton's poor food colin also witnesses the kind of treatment given to his fellows who are not so fortunate  beatings breadandwater diets demeaning work in the machine shop or the kitchen finally the day of the fivemile race against ranley arrives and colin quickly sizes up who the school's best runner is  and who he must beat with a proud governor looking on the starting gun is fired colin soon overtakes ranley's star runner and has a comfortable lead with a sure win but a series of jarring images run through his mind jumpcut flashes of his life at home and his mother's neglect his father's dead body stern lectures from detectives police the governor the hopelessness of any future life with audrey just yards from the finish line he stops running and remains in place despite the calls howls protests from the ruxton towers crowd and especially the governor in closeup we see colin look directly at the governor as a rebellious sneer plays on his face the expression remains there as the ranley runner passes him and crosses the finish line to victory the governor's anger is evident at the end of the film colin is back in the machine shop punished and now ignored by the governor but he seems calm even content because in the end he has refused to submit to authority and has settled into the loneliness of the title\",\n",
