1,"Liver cancer is cancer that begins in the cells of your liver. Your liver is a football-sized organ that sits in the upper right portion of your abdomen, beneath your diaphragm and above your stomach.

Several types of cancer can form in the liver. The most common type of liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma, which begins in the main type of liver cell (hepatocyte). Other types of liver cancer, such as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and hepatoblastoma, are much less common.

Cancer that spreads to the liver is more common than cancer that begins in the liver cells. Cancer that begins in another area of the body — such as the colon, lung or breast — and then spreads to the liver is called metastatic cancer rather than liver cancer. This type of cancer is named after the organ in which it began — such as metastatic colon cancer to describe cancer that begins in the colon and spreads to the liver.","Most people don't have signs and symptoms in the early stages of primary liver cancer. When signs and symptoms do appear, they may include:

Losing weight without trying
Loss of appetite
Upper abdominal pain
Nausea and vomiting
General weakness and fatigue
Abdominal swelling
Yellow discoloration of your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice)
White, chalky stools","Liver cancer happens when liver cells develop changes (mutations) in their DNA. A cell's DNA is the material that provides instructions for every chemical process in your body. DNA mutations cause changes in these instructions. One result is that cells may begin to grow out of control and eventually form a tumor — a mass of cancerous cells.

Sometimes the cause of liver cancer is known, such as with chronic hepatitis infections. But sometimes liver cancer happens in people with no underlying diseases and it's not clear what causes it.

Risk factors
Factors that increase the risk of primary liver cancer include:

Chronic infection with HBV or HCV. Chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) increases your risk of liver cancer.
Cirrhosis. This progressive and irreversible condition causes scar tissue to form in your liver and increases your chances of developing liver cancer.
Certain inherited liver diseases. Liver diseases that can increase the risk of liver cancer include hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease.
Diabetes. People with this blood sugar disorder have a greater risk of liver cancer than those who don't have diabetes.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. An accumulation of fat in the liver increases the risk of liver cancer.
Exposure to aflatoxins. Aflatoxins are poisons produced by molds that grow on crops that are stored poorly. Crops, such as grains and nuts, can become contaminated with aflatoxins, which can end up in foods made of these products.
Excessive alcohol consumption. Consuming more than a moderate amount of alcohol daily over many years can lead to irreversible liver damage and increase your risk of liver cancer.

Excessive alcohol consumption. Consuming more than a moderate amount of alcohol daily over many years can lead to irreversible liver damage and increase your risk of liver cancer.","Tests and procedures used to diagnose liver cancer include:

Blood tests. Blood tests may reveal liver function abnormalities.
Imaging tests. Your doctor may recommend imaging tests, such as an ultrasound, CT and MRI.
Removing a sample of liver tissue for testing. Sometimes it's necessary to remove a piece of liver tissue for laboratory testing in order to make a definitive diagnosis of liver cancer.

During a liver biopsy, your doctor inserts a thin needle through your skin and into your liver to obtain a tissue sample. In the lab, doctors examine the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. Liver biopsy carries a risk of bleeding, bruising and infection.

Determining the extent of the liver cancer
Once liver cancer is diagnosed, your doctor will work to determine the extent (stage) of the cancer. Staging tests help determine the size and location of cancer and whether it has spread. Imaging tests used to stage liver cancer include CTs, MRIs and bone scans.

There are different methods of staging liver cancer. For example, one method uses Roman numerals I through IV, and another uses letters A through D. Your doctor uses your cancer's stage to determine your treatment options and your prognosis.","Treatments for primary liver cancer depend on the extent (stage) of the disease as well as your age, overall health and personal preferences.

Surgery
Operations used to treat liver cancer include:

Surgery to remove the tumor. In certain situations, your doctor may recommend an operation to remove the liver cancer and a small portion of healthy liver tissue that surrounds it if your tumor is small and your liver function is good.

Whether this is an option for you also depends on the location of your cancer within the liver, how well your liver functions and your overall health.

Liver transplant surgery. During liver transplant surgery, your diseased liver is removed and replaced with a healthy liver from a donor. Liver transplant surgery is only an option for a small percentage of people with early-stage liver cancer.
Localized treatments
Localized treatments for liver cancer are those that are administered directly to the cancer cells or the area surrounding the cancer cells. Localized treatment options for liver cancer include:

Heating cancer cells. Radiofrequency ablation uses electric current to heat and destroy cancer cells. Using an imaging test as a guide, such as ultrasound, the doctor inserts one or more thin needles into small incisions in your abdomen. When the needles reach the tumor, they're heated with an electric current, destroying the cancer cells. Other procedures to heat the cancer cells might use microwaves or lasers.
Freezing cancer cells. Cryoablation uses extreme cold to destroy cancer cells. During the procedure, your doctor places an instrument (cryoprobe) containing liquid nitrogen directly onto liver tumors. Ultrasound images are used to guide the cryoprobe and monitor the freezing of the cells.
Injecting alcohol into the tumor. During alcohol injection, pure alcohol is injected directly into tumors, either through the skin or during an operation. Alcohol causes the tumor cells to die.
Injecting chemotherapy drugs into the liver. Chemoembolization is a type of chemotherapy treatment that supplies strong anti-cancer drugs directly to the liver.
Placing beads filled with radiation in the liver. Tiny spheres that contain radiation may be placed directly in the liver where they can deliver radiation directly to the tumor.
Radiation therapy
This treatment uses high-powered energy from sources such as X-rays and protons to destroy cancer cells and shrink tumors. Doctors carefully direct the energy to the liver, while sparing the surrounding healthy tissue.

Radiation therapy might be an option if other treatments aren't possible or if they haven't helped. For advanced liver cancer, radiation therapy might help control symptoms.

During external beam radiation therapy treatment, you lie on a table and a machine directs the energy beams at a precise point on your body.

A specialized type of radiation therapy, called stereotactic body radiotherapy, involves focusing many beams of radiation simultaneously at one point in your body.

Targeted drug therapy
Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die.

Many targeted drugs are available for treating advanced liver cancer.

Some targeted therapies only work in people whose cancer cells have certain genetic mutations. Your cancer cells may be tested in a laboratory to see if these drugs might help you.

Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy uses your immune system to fight cancer. Your body's disease-fighting immune system may not attack your cancer because the cancer cells produce proteins that blind the immune system cells. Immunotherapy works by interfering with that process.

Immunotherapy treatments are generally reserved for people with advanced liver cancer.

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill rapidly growing cells, including cancer cells. Chemotherapy can be administered through a vein in your arm, in pill form or both.

Chemotherapy is sometimes used to treat advanced liver cancer.

Supportive (palliative) care
Palliative care is specialized medical care that focuses on providing relief from pain and other symptoms of a serious illness. Palliative care specialists work with you, your family and your other doctors to provide an extra layer of support that complements your ongoing care. Palliative care can be used while undergoing other aggressive treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

When palliative care is used along with all of the other appropriate treatments, people with cancer may feel better and live longer.

Palliative care is provided by a team of doctors, nurses and other specially trained professionals. Palliative care teams aim to improve the quality of life for people with cancer and their families. This form of care is offered alongside curative or other treatments you may be receiving.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/liver-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353659
2,"Liver cancer is a cancer that's found anywhere in the liver.
The liver is a large organ at the top right side of your tummy.
It helps you digest your food and removes toxins.
Liver cancer can sometimes start in your liver (primary) or spread from another organ (secondary).
How serious liver cancer is depends on where it is in the liver, how big it is, if it has spread, if it's primary or secondary and your general health.","Liver cancer may not have any symptoms, or they might be hard to spot.

The symptoms are the same if the liver cancer starts in the liver (primary liver cancer) or spreads from another part of the body (secondary liver cancer).

Symptoms of liver cancer can include:

your skin or the whites of your eyes turn yellow (jaundice), you may also have itchy skin, darker pee and paler poo than usual
loss of appetite or losing weight without trying to
feeling tired or having no energy
feeling generally unwell or having symptoms like flu
a lump in the right side of your tummy
Other symptoms can affect your digestion, such as:

feeling or being sick
pain at the top right side of your tummy or in your right shoulder
symptoms of indigestion, such as feeling full very quickly when eating
a very swollen tummy that is not related to when you eat","Anyone can get primary liver cancer. It's not always clear what causes it.

You might be more likely to get it if you:

are over the age of 60, it's most common in people over 85
are a man
have certain medical conditions, such as hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, gallstones, diabetes, a parasite in the liver (liver flukes), and HIV
have a brother, sister or parent who had primary liver cancer
Secondary liver cancer is caused by cancer cells from a cancer somewhere else in the body spreading to the liver.

Many liver cancers are also linked to your lifestyle.","You will need more tests and scans to check for liver cancer if the GP refers you to a specialist.

These tests can include:

blood tests
scans, like an ultrasound scan, CT scan or MRI scan
collecting a small sample of cells from the liver (called a biopsy), to be checked for cancer
You may not have all these tests.

If you've already had another kind of cancer and the specialist thinks it might have spread to your liver (secondary liver cancer) you may also have a PET scan.

These tests can also help find problems in your bile ducts, pancreas or gallbladder.","Liver cancer is often treatable, but it can be difficult to treat.

The treatment you have will depend on:

if the cancer started in the liver (primary) or spread from somewhere else (secondary), but treatments for primary and secondary liver cancer are similar
the size and type of liver cancer you have
where it is
if it has spread
your general health
It may include surgery, chemotherapy, using heat to destroy the cancer (thermal ablation), and using targeted medicines.

The specialist care team looking after you will:

explain the treatments, benefits and side effects
work with you to create a treatment plan that is best for you
help you manage any side effects, including changes to your diet to help you digest your food
You'll have regular check-ups during and after any treatments. You may also have tests and scans.

If you have any symptoms or side effects that you are worried about, talk to your specialists. You do not need to wait for your next check-up.

Surgery
If liver cancer is found early, is small and it has not spread, you may be able to have surgery to remove it.

Surgery will remove part or all of your liver. If it is all removed you will need a liver transplant to replace your liver with a donated one.

Recovery from surgery to treat liver cancer can take a long time. The specialist team looking after you will discuss all the benefits and side effects.",https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/liver-cancer/treatment/
3,"Liver cancer is cancer that occurs in the liver. The liver is the largest glandular organ in the body and performs various critical functions to keep the body free of toxins and harmful substances.

The liver is located in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, right below the ribs. It’s responsible for producing bile, which is a substance that helps you digest fats, vitamins, and other nutrients.

This vital organ also stores nutrients such as glucose, so that you remain nourished at times when you’re not eating. It also breaks down medications and toxins.

When cancer develops in the liver, it destroys liver cells and interferes with the ability of the liver to function normally.

Liver cancer is generally classified as primary or secondary. Primary liver cancer begins in the cells of the liver. Secondary liver cancer develops when cancer cells from another organ spread to the liver.

Unlike other cells in the body, cancer cells can break away from the primary site, or where the cancer began.

The cells travel to other areas of the body through the bloodstream or the lymphatic system. Cancer cells eventually collect in another body organ and begin to grow there","Many people don’t experience symptoms in the early stages of primary liver cancer. When symptoms do appear, they may include:

abdominal discomfort, pain, and tenderness
yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes, which is called jaundice
white, chalky stools
nausea
vomiting
bruising or bleeding easily
weakness
fatigue","Liver cancer is more common in people over age 50.
A long-term hepatitis B or C infection can severely damage your liver. Hepatitis is spread from person-to-person through direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person, such as their blood or semen. It may also be passed from mother to child during childbirth. You can lower your risk for hepatitis B and C by using protection during sexual intercourse. There’s also a vaccine that can protect you against hepatitis B.
Having two or more alcoholic beverages every day over many years increases your risk for liver cancer.
Cirrhosis is a form of liver damage in which healthy tissue is replaced by scarred tissue. A scarred liver can’t function properly and may ultimately lead to numerous complications, including liver cancer. Long-term alcohol abuse and hepatitis C are the most common causes of cirrhosis in the United States. The majority of Americans with liver cancer have cirrhosis before they develop liver cancer.
Exposure to aflatoxin is a risk factor. Aflatoxin is a toxic substance produced by a type of mold that can grow on peanuts, grains, and corn. In the United States, food-handling laws limit widespread exposure to aflatoxin. Outside of the country, however, aflatoxin exposure can be high.
Diabetes and obesity are also risk factors. People with diabetes tend to be overweight or obese, which can cause liver problems and increase risk for liver cancer","The diagnosis of liver cancer begins with a medical history and a physical examination. Make sure to tell your doctor if you have a history of long-term alcohol abuse or a chronic hepatitis B or C infection.

Diagnostic tests and procedures for liver cancer include the following:

Liver function tests help your doctor determine the health of your liver by measuring levels of proteins, liver enzymes, and bilirubin in your blood.
The presence of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the blood can be a sign of liver cancer. This protein is usually only produced in the liver and yolk sac of babies before they’re born. AFP production normally stops after birth.
Abdominal CT or MRI scans produce detailed images of the liver and other organs in the abdomen. They can allow your doctor to pinpoint where a tumor is developing, determine its size, and assess whether it has spread to other organs.","Treatment for liver cancer varies. It depends on:

the number, size, and location of the tumors in the liver
how well the liver is functioning
whether cirrhosis is present
whether the tumor has spread to other organs
Your specific treatment plan will be based on these factors. Liver cancer treatments may include the following:

Hepatectomy
A hepatectomy is performed to remove either a portion of the liver or all of the liver. This surgery is usually done when the cancer is confined to the liver. Over time, the remaining healthy tissue will regrow and replace the missing part.

Liver transplant
A liver transplant involves replacing the entire diseased liver with a healthy liver from a suitable donor. A transplant can only be done if the cancer hasn’t spread to other organs. Medicines to prevent rejection are given after the transplant.

Ablation
Ablation involves the use of heat or ethanol injections to destroy the cancer cells. It’s performed using local anesthesia. This numbs the area to prevent you from feeling any pain. Ablation can help people who aren’t candidates for surgery or a transplant.

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is an aggressive form of drug therapy that destroys cancer cells. The medications are injected intravenously, or through a vein. In most cases, chemotherapy can be given as an outpatient treatment.

Chemotherapy can be effective in treating liver cancer, but many people experience side effects during treatment, including vomiting, decreased appetite, and chills. Chemotherapy can also increase your risk of infection.

Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy involves the use of high-energy radiation beams to kill cancer cells. It can be delivered by external beam radiation or by internal radiation.

In external beam radiation, the radiation is aimed at the abdomen and chest. Internal radiation involves the use of a catheter to inject tiny radioactive spheres into the hepatic artery.

The radiation then destroys the hepatic artery, a blood vessel that supplies blood to the liver. This decreases the amount of blood flowing to the tumor. When the hepatic artery is closed off, the portal vein continues to nourish the liver.

Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy involves the use of medications that are designed to hit cancer cells where they’re vulnerable. They decrease tumor growth and help shut down blood supply to the tumor.

Sorafenib (Nexavar) has been approved as targeted therapy for people with liver cancer. Targeted therapy can be helpful for people who aren’t candidates for a hepatectomy or liver transplant.

Targeted therapy can, however, have significant side effects.

Embolization and chemoembolization
Embolization and chemoembolization are surgical procedures. They’re done to block off the hepatic artery. Your doctor will use small sponges or other particles to do this. This reduces the amount of blood flowing to the tumor.

In chemoembolization, your doctor injects chemotherapy drugs into the hepatic artery before the particles are injected. The blockage created keeps the chemotherapy medications in the liver for a longer period.",https://www.healthline.com/health/liver-cancer
4,"The liver is located on the upper right side of the body, behind the lower ribs. The liver does many jobs, including—

Storing nutrients.
Removing waste products and worn-out cells from the blood.
Filtering and processing chemicals in food, alcohol, and medications.
Producing bile, a solution that helps digest fats and eliminate waste products.","In its early stages, liver cancer may not have symptoms that can be seen or felt. However, as the cancer grows larger, people may notice one or more of these common symptoms. It’s important to remember that these symptoms could also be caused by other health conditions. If you have any of these symptoms, talk to your doctor.

Liver cancer symptoms may include—

Discomfort in the upper abdomen on the right side.
A swollen abdomen.
A hard lump on the right side just below the rib cage.
Pain near the right shoulder blade or in the back.
Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes).
Easy bruising or bleeding.
Unusual tiredness.
Nausea and vomiting.
Loss of appetite.
Weight loss for no known reason","Behaviors and conditions that increase risk for getting liver cancer are—

Being overweight or having obesity.
Having a long-term hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infection.
Smoking cigarettes.
Drinking alcohol.
Having cirrhosis (scarring of the liver, which can also be caused by hepatitis and alcohol use).
Having nonalcoholic fatty liver diseaseexternal icon (extra fat in the liver that is not caused by alcohol).
Having diabetes or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
Having hemochromatosis, a condition where the body takes up and stores more iron than it needs.
Eating foods that have aflatoxin (a fungus that can grow on foods, such as grains and nuts that have not been stored properly).",,,https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/liver/index.htm
5,"Liver disease is a progression that follows stages of illness. Some people with liver disease progress to cirrhosis (scarring) of the liver, which puts them at increased risk for liver cancer.

Liver cancer is more common among men than women.

The most current data indicates that liver cancer is among the top ten causes of death in the USA among all races, ethnicities, and genders. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017)  It claims the lives of approximately 34,000 Americans each year.

Liver cancer may have genetic or hereditary causes that are outside of our control. We may, however, be able to reduce our risk for developing liver cancer by being aware of the most common causes.

There are treatment options for people with liver cancer. Doctors suggest treatments based on type of cancer present, stage of cancer, and other information obtained through medical test results.","People may not feel ill in the earliest stages of liver cancer, which is why it is very important to understand your risks and to talk to your doctor about liver cancer before you experience symptoms.

Once symptoms occur, they can include:

Fatigue
Bloating or feelings of fullness
Pain on the right side of the upper abdomen or back and shoulder
Nausea
Loss of appetite
Weight loss
Weakness
Fever
Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes)","A risk factor is something that increases the possibility of developing a disease. Certain conditions or behaviors can increase a person’s chances of developing liver cancer. Having cirrhosis is a risk factor for developing hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer). Cirrhosis is severe scarring of the liver due to a progression of damage to the liver, usually over many years. People often think that overuse of alcohol is the only way that cirrhosis can occur. In fact, drinking alcohol in excess is only one way in which a person can get cirrhosis.

Long-term (chronic) hepatitis B and hepatitis C infections are linked to liver cancer because they often lead to cirrhosis if they are undiagnosed and/or untreated. Hepatitis B is an exception to the norm in that it can lead to liver cancer without first causing cirrhosis in the progression of liver damage.

People with fatty liver may over time develop complications including cirrhosis, thereby putting them at risk for liver cancer. Certain conditions increase one’s chances of having fatty liver, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, and high triglycerides.

People with certain hereditary and/or rare diseases may be prone to developing liver cancer. These include:

Wilson Disease
Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency
Hemochromatosis
Glycogen storage disease
Advanced PBC
Porphyria cutanea tarda
Tyrosinemia
Environmental exposure to aflatoxins (poisonous cancer-causing agents produced by molds that grow in soil, decaying vegetation, hay, and grains) may lead to liver cancer.

Finally, long-term use of anabolic steroids has been linked to the development of liver cancer in some people.

People with any risk factor, or those who have been diagnosed with cirrhosis, should speak with their doctors about cancer screening and surveillance so that should cancer develop, it may be diagnosed sooner rather than later.","Liver cancer is diagnosed through a physical examination and special medical tests. Diagnosis may include ultrasounds, CT scans, and MRI. Sometimes doctors may perform a liver biopsy, a procedure in which a small piece of liver tissue is removed and studied to confirm the diagnosis of liver cancer. Doctors may often do genetic testing of the cancer to help determine the best type of treatment for the patient","Liver cancer treatment depends on:

The liver’s condition and the extent of cirrhosis
The size, location, and number of tumors
Whether the cancer has spread outside the liver or has remained within the liver
The overall health of the patient and other risk factors for liver cancer
transplant teamIf the cancer has not spread and the rest of the liver is healthy, treatment options may include:

Transplant (replacement of the liver)
Partial hepatectomy or segmentectomy (surgery to remove a part of the liver or to remove a tumor from the liver)
Radiofrequency ablation (inserting a thin probe through the skin and into the tumor to heat and destroy the cancer cells)
Sometimes the cancer may be contained within the liver but is not responsive to the above treatments. If this is the case, other treatments may include:

Bland embolization, chemoembolization, or radioembolization of the blood vessels near the tumor (procedures to block the blood supply to the tumor, either with or without the use of anti-cancer medications)
Radiation therapy (high-energy x-rays) to destroy cancer cells.
If the cancer has spread outside of the liver, or if it is still within the liver but not responsive to any of the above treatments, doctors may recommend some of the following treatments (either separately or in combination):

Oral (by mouth) anti-cancer medications
Immunotherapy (a type of treatment that helps your immune system fight cancer)
Clinical trials (scientific studies to test new medications not yet available to the public
A successful liver transplant, also called a surgical resection, can cure liver cancer, but it is an option for only a small percentage of patients. Surgical resections are successful in only about one out of three cases. However, scientists are experimenting with several promising new treatments that could help prolong the lives of people with liver cancer.",
