1,"Rectal cancer is cancer that begins in the rectum. The rectum is the last several inches of the large intestine. It starts at the end of the final segment of your colon and ends when it reaches the short, narrow passage leading to the anus.

Cancer inside the rectum (rectal cancer) and cancer inside the colon (colon cancer) are often referred to together as ""colorectal cancer.""

While rectal and colon cancers are similar in many ways, their treatments are quite different. This is mainly because the rectum sits in a tight space, barely separated from other organs and structures. The tight space can make surgery to remove rectal cancer complex.

In the past, long-term survival was uncommon for people with rectal cancer, even after extensive treatment. Thanks to treatment advances over the last few decades, rectal cancer survival rates have greatly improved.","Signs and symptoms of rectal cancer include:

A change in bowel habits, such as diarrhea, constipation or more-frequent bowel movements
Dark maroon or bright red blood in stool
Narrow stool
A feeling that your bowel doesn't empty completely
Abdominal pain
Unexplained weight loss
Weakness or fatigue","Rectal cancer begins when healthy cells in the rectum develop changes (mutations) in their DNA. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do.

The changes tell the cells to grow uncontrollably and to continue living after healthy cells would die. The accumulating cells can form a tumor. With time, the cancer cells can grow to invade and destroy healthy tissue nearby. And cancerous cells can break away and travel (metastasize) to other parts of the body.

For most rectal cancers, it's not clear what causes the mutations that cause the cancer to form.Factors that may increase the risk of rectal cancer are the same as those that increase the risk of colon cancer. Colorectal cancer risk factors include:

Older age. Colorectal cancer can be diagnosed at any age, but most people with this type of cancer are older than 50. The rates of colorectal cancer in people younger than 50 have been increasing, but doctors aren't sure why.
African-American descent. People of African ancestry born in the United States have a greater risk of colorectal cancer than do people of European ancestry.
A personal history of colorectal cancer or polyps. Your risk of colorectal cancer is higher if you've already had rectal cancer, colon cancer or adenomatous polyps.
Inflammatory bowel disease. Chronic inflammatory diseases of the colon and rectum, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, increase your risk of colorectal cancer.
Inherited syndromes that increase rectal cancer risk. Genetic syndromes passed through generations of your family can increase your risk of colon and rectal cancer, including FAP and Lynch syndrome.
Family history of colorectal cancer. You're more likely to develop colorectal cancer if you have a parent, sibling or child with colon or rectal cancer.
Eating a diet low in vegetables. Colorectal cancer may be associated with a diet low in vegetables and high in red meat, particularly when the meat is charred or well done.
Too little exercise. If you're inactive, you're more likely to develop colorectal cancer. Getting regular physical activity may reduce your risk of cancer.
Diabetes. People with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes may have an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
Obesity. Obese people have an increased risk of colorectal cancer when compared with people considered at a healthy weight.
Smoking. People who smoke may have an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
Drinking alcohol. Regularly drinking more than three alcoholic beverages a week may increase your risk of colorectal cancer.
Radiation therapy for previous cancer. Radiation therapy directed at the abdomen to treat previous cancers may increase the risk of colorectal cancer","Tests to diagnose rectal cancer
Colonoscopy exam
Open pop-up dialog box
Rectal cancer can be found during a screening test for colorectal cancer. Or it may be suspected based on your symptoms. Tests and procedures used to confirm the diagnosis include:

Using a scope to examine the inside of your colon and rectum (colonoscopy). Colonoscopy uses a long, flexible tube (colonoscope) attached to a video camera and monitor to view your colon and rectum. If cancer is found in your rectum, your doctor may recommend examining your colon in order to look for additional suspicious areas.
Removing a sample of tissue for testing (biopsy). If any suspicious areas are found, your doctor can pass surgical tools through the colonoscope to take tissue samples (biopsies) for analysis and remove polyps.

The tissue sample is sent to a lab to be examined by doctors who specialize in analyzing blood and body tissues (pathologists). Tests can determine whether the cells are cancer, whether they're aggressive and which genes in the cancer cells are abnormal. Your doctor uses this information to understand your prognosis and determine your treatment options.

Tests to look for rectal cancer spread
Once you're diagnosed with rectal cancer, the next step is to determine the cancer's extent (stage). The stage of your cancer helps determine your prognosis and your treatment options.

Staging tests include:

Complete blood count (CBC). This test reports the numbers of different types of cells in your blood. A CBC shows whether your red blood cell count is low (anemia), which suggests that a tumor is causing blood loss. A high level of white blood cells is a sign of infection, which is a risk if a rectal tumor grows through the wall of the rectum.
Blood tests to measure organ function. A chemistry panel is a blood test to measures levels of different chemicals in the blood. Abnormal levels of some of these chemicals may suggest that cancer has spread to the liver. High levels of other chemicals may indicate problems with other organs, such as the kidneys.
Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Cancers sometimes produce substances called tumor markers that can be detected in blood. One such marker, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), may be higher than usual in people with colorectal cancer. CEA testing is particularly useful in monitoring your response to treatment.
CT scan of the chest. This imaging test helps determine whether rectal cancer has spread to other organs, such as the liver and lungs.
MRI of the pelvis. An MRI provides a detailed image of the muscles, organs and other tissues surrounding a tumor in the rectum. An MRI also shows the lymph nodes near the rectum and different layers of tissue in the rectal wall.
Your doctor uses information from these tests to assign your cancer a stage. The stages of rectal cancer are indicated by Roman numerals that range from 0 to IV. The lowest stage indicates cancer that is limited to the lining of the inside of the rectum. By stage IV, the cancer is considered advanced and has spread (metastasized) to other areas of the body.","Rectal cancer treatment often involves a combination of therapies. When possible, surgery is used to cut away the cancer cells. Other treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, may be used after surgery to kill any cancer cells that remain and reduce the risk that cancer will return.

If surgeons are concerned that the cancer can't be removed completely without hurting nearby organs and structures, your doctor may recommend a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy as your initial treatment. These combined treatments may shrink the cancer and make it easier to remove during an operation.

Surgery
Rectal cancer is often treated with surgery to remove the cancer cells. Which operation is best for you depends on your particular situation, such as the location and stage of your cancer, how aggressive the cancer cells are, your overall health, and your preferences.

Operations used to treat rectal cancer include:

Removing very small cancers from the inside of the rectum. Very small rectal cancers may be removed using a colonoscope or another specialized type of scope inserted through the anus (transanal local excision). Surgical tools can be passed through the scope to cut away the cancer and some of the healthy tissue around it.

This procedure might be an option if your cancer is small and unlikely to spread to nearby lymph nodes. If a lab analysis finds that your cancer cells are aggressive or more likely to spread to the lymph nodes, your doctor may recommend additional surgery.

Removing all or part of the rectum. Larger rectal cancers that are far enough away from the anal canal might be removed in a procedure (low anterior resection) that removes all or part of the rectum. Nearby tissue and lymph nodes are also removed. This procedure preserves the anus so that waste can leave the body normally.

How the procedure is performed depends on the cancer's location. If cancer affects the upper portion of the rectum, that part of the rectum is removed and then the colon is attached to the remaining rectum (colorectal anastomosis). All of the rectum may be removed if the cancer is located in the lower portion of the rectum. Then the colon is shaped into a pouch and attached to the anus (coloanal anastomosis).

Removing the rectum and anus. For rectal cancers that are located near the anus, it might not be possible to remove the cancer completely without damaging the muscles that control bowel movements. In these situations, surgeons may recommend an operation called abdominoperineal resection (APR) to remove the rectum, anus and some of the colon, as well as nearby tissue and lymph nodes.

The surgeon creates an opening in the abdomen and attaches the remaining colon (colostomy). Waste leaves your body through the opening and collects in a bag that attaches to your abdomen.

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy uses drugs to destroy cancer cells. For rectal cancer, chemotherapy might be recommended after surgery to kill any cancer cells that might remain.

Chemotherapy combined with radiation therapy might also be used before an operation to shrink a large cancer so that it's easier to remove with surgery.

Chemotherapy can also be used to relieve symptoms of rectal cancer that can't be removed with surgery or that has spread to other areas of the body.

Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy uses powerful energy sources, such as X-rays and protons, to kill cancer cells. In people with rectal cancer, radiation therapy is often combined with chemotherapy that makes the cancer cells more likely to be damaged by the radiation. It can be used after surgery to kill any cancer cells that might remain. Or it can be used before surgery to shrink a cancer and make it easier to remove.

When surgery isn't an option, radiation therapy might be used to relieve symptoms, such as pain.

Combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy
Combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy (chemoradiotherapy) makes cancer cells more vulnerable to radiation. The combination is often used for larger rectal cancers and those that have a higher risk of returning after surgery.

Chemoradiotherapy may be recommended:

Before surgery. Chemoradiotherapy may help shrink the cancer enough to make a less invasive surgery possible. The combined treatment may increase the chance that your operation will leave the anal area intact so waste can leave the body normally after surgery.
After surgery. If surgery was your first treatment, your doctor may recommend chemoradiotherapy afterward if there's an increased risk that your cancer may return.
As the primary treatment. Your doctor may recommend chemoradiotherapy to control the growth of cancer if your rectal cancer is advanced or if surgery isn't an option.
Targeted drug therapy
Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die.

Targeted drugs are usually combined with chemotherapy. Targeted drugs are typically reserved for people with advanced rectal cancer.

Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy is a drug treatment that uses your immune system to fight cancer. Your body's disease-fighting immune system may not attack your cancer because the cancer cells produce proteins that help them hide from the immune system cells. Immunotherapy works by interfering with that process.

Immunotherapy is usually reserved for advanced rectal cancer.

Supportive (palliative) care
Palliative care is focused on providing relief from pain and other symptoms of a severe illness. Palliative care specialists work with you, your family and your other doctors to provide an extra layer of support that complements your ongoing care.

Palliative care is provided by a team of doctors, nurses and other specially trained professionals. Palliative care teams aim to improve the quality of life for people with cancer and their families. This form of care is offered alongside curative or other treatments you may be receiving.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rectal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352884
2,"The rectum is the last 6 inches of the large intestine (colon). Rectal cancer arises from the lining of the rectum. In 2012, more than 40,000 people in the United States will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer, making it the third most common cancer in both men and women. About 5% of Americans will develop colorectal cancer during their lifetimes. Colorectal cancer is highly curable if detected in the early stages.","Rectal cancer may show no obvious symptoms in early stages. As the disease develops, symptoms may include changes in bowel movements, rectal bleeding and thin, ribbon-like stool. Other signs and symptoms include:

Fatigue
Weight loss
Blood in the stool
Diarrhea and/or constipation
Abdominal pain
Bloating
A feeling that you are unable to empty your bowels
If the cancer metastasizes, or spreads to other parts of the body, symptoms may vary depending on where in the body the cancer is located. Symptoms of metastatic rectal cancer may include:

Persistent cough
Fatigue
Bone pain
Shortness of breath
Loss of appetite
Jaundice
Swelling in the hands and feet
Changes in vision or speech","The cause of rectal cancer is unknown, but the risk of developing the disease increases with age. People with a family history of colorectal cancer or certain hereditary cancer syndromes have a higher risk. Other known risk factors for rectal cancer include:

Diet
Smoking
Alcohol use
Sedentary lifestyle
Obesity
Diabetes","A variety of laboratory and imaging tests may be used to diagnose cancer of the rectum and determine the stage of the disease. Commonly used procedures and tools include:

Laboratory tests, such as blood tests and advance genomic testing
Biopsy
Colonoscopy
Imaging tests, such as MRI, CT scan and ultrasound
These tests may also be used to monitor your response to treatment.","Treatment for rectal cancer often depends on the stage of the disease and the extent to which it has developed. Treatment options include:

Surgery
Immunotherapy
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Targeted therapy
Clinical trials
If cancer of the rectum is found early, active surveillance may be an option for some patients. During active surveillance, a doctor closely monitors the patient to look for signs that the cancer is growing. Patients may undergo several tests during active surveillance, including a digital rectal examination, MRI and/or colonoscopy",https://www.cancercenter.com/cancer-types/colorectal-cancer/types/rectal-cancer
3,"Rectal cancer is cancer that develops in cells in the rectum. The rectum is located below the sigmoid colon and above the anus.

Your rectum and colon are both part of the digestive system, so rectal and colon cancers are often grouped under the term colorectal cancer.

Worldwide, colorectal cancer is the second most common cancer in females and the third most common cancer in males.

The American Cancer Society estimates there will be 43,340 new cases of rectal cancer in the United States in 2020. This compares with 104,610 new cases of colon ","Some symptoms of rectal cancer could be due to other conditions. These symptoms include:

weakness and fatigue
appetite changes
weight loss
frequent abdominal discomfort, gas, cramps, pain
Other signs and symptoms of rectal cancer include:

changes in how often you have bowel movements
feeling that your bowel isn’t emptying completely
pain when you have a bowel movement
diarrhea or constipation
blood or mucus in your stool
narrow stool
iron deficiency anemia","Mistakes in DNA can cause cells to grow out of control. Faulty cells pile up to form tumors. These cells can penetrate and destroy healthy tissue. What sets off this process isn’t always clear.

There are some inherited gene mutations that can increase risk. One of these is hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, known as Lynch syndrome. This disorder raises the risk of colon and other cancers, especially before age 50.

Another such syndrome is familial adenomatous polyposis. This is a rare disorder that can cause polyps in the lining of the colon and rectum. Without treatment, it can raise the risk of colon or rectal cancer, especially before age 40.

Other risk factors for rectal cancer are:

Age. Diagnosis usually occurs after age 50, although rates are increasing among younger people.
Race. Black Americans are at higher risk than other groups of developing rectal cancer. One reason for this may be inequities in healthcare access.
Family history. Personal or family history of colorectal cancer can raise risk.
Radiation therapy. Previous radiation treatment to the abdomen can increase risk.
Other conditions that may increase risk include:

ovarian cancer
polyps
inflammatory bowel disease
obesity
type 2 diabetes that’s not well managed
Some lifestyle factors that may play a role in colorectal cancer are:

diet with too few vegetables and too much red meat, particularly well-done meat
lack of exercise
smoking
consuming more than three alcoholic drinks a week","Your doctor will likely begin by taking your medical history and performing a physical examination. This may include inserting a gloved finger into your rectum to feel for lumps.

Your doctor might next recommend a fecal immunochemical test (FIT) or a sigmoidoscopy. The screening schedule for these tests will vary depending on your risk level. If these tests are positive for cancer, a colonoscopy is the next step.

In a colonoscopy, your doctor uses a thin tube with a light and camera at the end to view the inside of your rectum and colon. They can usually remove any polyps they find at this time.

During the colonoscopy, your doctor can also collect tissue samples for later examination in a lab. These samples can be viewed under a microscope to determine if they’re cancerous. They can also be tested for genetic mutations associated with colorectal cancer.

Your doctor may also order a blood test. A high level of carcinoembryonic antigen, a substance made by cancerous tumors, in your bloodstream may indicate rectal cancer.

Once your doctor makes their diagnosis of rectal cancer, their next step is to determine how far it might have spread.

Your doctor can use an endorectal ultrasound to examine your rectum and surrounding area. For this test, your doctor inserts a probe into your rectum to produce a sonogram, a type of image.

Your doctor may use other imaging tests to look for signs of cancer throughout your body. These include:

X-ray
CT or PET scan
MRI","In recommending treatment, your doctor will consider:

tumor size
where cancer may have spread
your age
your general health
This helps them determine the best combination of treatments, as well as the timing of each treatment.

Below are the general guidelines for treatment by stage.

Stage 0
removal of suspicious tissue during colonoscopy
removal of tissue during a separate surgery
removal of tissue and part of the surrounding area
Stage 1
local excision or resection
radiation therapy
chemotherapy
Stages 2 and 3
surgery
radiation therapy
chemotherapy
Stage 4
surgery, possibly in more than one area of the body
radiation therapy
chemotherapy
targeted therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies or angiogenesis inhibitors
cryosurgery, a procedure that uses a cold liquid or a cryoprobe to destroy abnormal tissue
radiofrequency ablation, a procedure in which radio waves are used to destroy abnormal cells
a stent to keep the rectum open if it’s blocked by a tumor
palliative therapy to improve overall quality of life
You can also ask your doctor about clinical trials that might be a good fit for you.",https://www.healthline.com/health/rectal-cancer#treatment
4,"Rectal cancer is a disease in which cancer cells form in the tissues of the rectum; colorectal cancer occurs in the colon or rectum. Adenocarcinomas comprise the vast majority (98%) of colon and rectal cancers; more rare rectal cancers include lymphoma (1.3%), carcinoid (0.4%), and sarcoma (0.3%).

The incidence and epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, and screening recommendations are common to both colon cancer and rectal cancer. The image below depicts the staging and workup of rectal cancer.","Bleeding is the most common symptom of rectal cancer, occurring in 60% of patients. However, many rectal cancers produce no symptoms and are discovered during digital or proctoscopic screening examinations.

Other signs and symptoms of rectal cancer may include the following:

Change in bowel habits (43%): Often in the form of diarrhea; the caliber of the stool may change; there may be a feeling of incomplete evacuation and tenesmus
Occult bleeding (26%): Detected via a fecal occult blood test (FOBT)
Abdominal pain (20%): May be colicky and accompanied by bloating
Back pain: Usually a late sign caused by a tumor invading or compressing nerve trunks
Urinary symptoms: May occur if a tumor invades or compresses the bladder or prostate
Malaise (9%)
Pelvic pain (5%): Late symptom, usually indicating nerve trunk involvement
Emergencies such as peritonitis from perforation (3%) or jaundice, which may occur with liver metastases (< 1%)",,"Perform physical examination with specific attention to the size and location of the rectal tumor as well as to possible metastatic lesions, including enlarged lymph nodes or hepatomegaly. In addition, evaluate the remainder of the colon.

Examination includes the use of the following:

Digital rectal examination (DRE): The average finger can reach approximately 8 cm above the dentate line; rectal tumors can be assessed for size, ulceration, and presence of any pararectal lymph nodes, as well as fixation to surrounding structures (eg, sphincters, prostate, vagina, coccyx and sacrum); sphincter function can be assessed

Rigid proctoscopy: This examination helps to identify the exact location of the tumor in relation to the sphincter mechanism

Laboratory tests

Screening tests may include the following:

Guaiac-based FOBT
Stool DNA screening (SDNA)
Fecal immunochemical test (FIT)
Rigid proctoscopy
Flexible sigmoidoscopy (FSIG)
Combined glucose-based FOBT and flexible sigmoidoscopy
Double-contrast barium enema (DCBE)
Computed tomography (CT) colonography
Fiberoptic flexible colonoscopy (FFC)
Routine laboratory studies in patients with suspected rectal cancer include the following:

Complete blood count
Serum chemistries
Liver and kidney function tests
Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) test
Histologic examination of tissue specimens
Imaging studies

If metastatic (local or systemic) rectal cancer is suspected, the following radiologic studies may be obtained:

CT scanning of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis
Endorectal ultrasonography
Endorectal or pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning: Not routinely indicated","A multidisciplinary approach that includes surgery, medical oncology, and radiation oncology is required for optimal treatment of patients with rectal cancer. Surgical technique, use of radiotherapy, and method of administering chemotherapy are important factors. 

Strong considerations should be given to the intent of surgery, possible functional outcome, and preservation of anal continence and genitourinary functions. The first step involves achievement of cure, because the risk of pelvic recurrence is high in patients with rectal cancer, and locally recurrent rectal cancer has a poor prognosis.

Surgery

Radical resection of the rectum is the mainstay of therapy. The timing of surgical resection is dependent on the size, location, extent, and grade of the rectal carcinoma. Operative management of rectal cancer may include the following:

Transanal excision: For early-stage cancers in a select group of patients

Transanal endoscopic microsurgery: Form of local excision that uses a special operating proctoscope that distends the rectum with insufflated carbon dioxide and allows the passage of dissecting instruments

Endocavity radiotherapy: Delivered under sedation via a special proctoscope in the operating room

Sphincter-sparing procedures: Low anterior resection, coloanal anastomosis, abdominal perineal resection

Adjuvant medical management

Adjuvant medical therapy may include the following:

Adjuvant radiation therapy
Intraoperative radiation therapy
Adjuvant chemotherapy
Adjuvant chemoradiation therapy
Radioembolization
Pharmacotherapy

National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend the use of as many chemotherapy drugs as possible to maximize the effect of adjuvant therapies for colon and rectal cancer. [1]

The following agents may be used in the management of rectal cancer:

Antineoplastic agents (eg, fluorouracil, vincristine, leucovorin, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, cetuximab, bevacizumab, panitumumab)

Vaccines (eg, quadrivalent human papillomavirus [HPV] vaccine)",https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/281237-overview
5,"The rectum is the lower part of the colon that connects the large bowel to the anus. The rectum's primary function is to store formed stool in preparation for evacuation. Like the colon, the three layers of the rectal wall are as follows:

Mucosa: This layer of the rectal wall lines the inner surface. The mucosa is composed of glands that secrete mucus to help the passage of stool.
Muscularis propria: This middle layer of the rectal wall is composed of muscles that help the rectum keep its shape and contract in a coordinated fashion to expel stool.
Mesorectum: This fatty tissue surrounds the rectum.
In addition to these three layers, another important component of the rectum is the surrounding lymph nodes (also called regional lymph nodes). Lymph nodes are part of the immune system and assist in conducting surveillance for harmful materials (including viruses and bacteria) that may be threatening the body. Lymph nodes surround every organ in the body, including the rectum.

The American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates about 95,520 new cases of colon cancer, and 39,910 new cases of rectal cancer will occur in 2017. Males are more likely than females to develop rectal cancer (about 23,720 males to 16,190 females in 2017). The most common type of rectal cancer is adenocarcinoma (98%), which is a cancer arising from the mucosa. Cancer cells can also spread from the rectum to the lymph nodes on their way to other parts of the body.

Like colon cancer, the prognosis and treatment of rectal cancer depends on how deeply the cancer has invaded the rectal wall and surrounding lymph nodes (its stage, or extent of spread). However, although the rectum is part of the colon, the location of the rectum in the pelvis poses additional challenges in treatment when compared with colon cancer.","Rectal cancer can cause many symptoms and signs that require a person to seek medical care. However, rectal cancer may also be present without any symptoms, underscoring the importance of routine health screening. Symptoms and signs to be aware of include the following:

Bleeding (the most common symptom; present in about 80% of individuals with rectal cancer)
Seeing blood mixed with stool is a sign to seek immediate medical care. Although many people bleed due to hemorrhoids, a doctor should still be notified in the event of rectal bleeding.
Change in bowel habits (more gas or excessive amounts of gas, smaller stools, diarrhea)
Prolonged rectal bleeding (perhaps in small quantities that is not seen in the stool) may lead to anemia, causing fatigue, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or a fast heartbeat.
Bowel obstruction
A rectal mass may grow so large that it prevents the normal passage of stool. This blockage may lead to the feeling of severe constipation or pain when having a bowel movement. In addition, abdominal pain, discomfort, or cramping may occur due to the blockage.
The stool size may appear narrow so that it can be passed around the rectal mass. Therefore, pencil-thin or narrow stools may be another sign of an obstruction from rectal cancer.
A person with rectal cancer may have a sensation that the stool cannot be completely evacuated after a bowel movement.
Weight loss: Cancer may cause weight loss. Unexplained weight loss (in the absence of dieting or a new exercise program) requires a medical evaluation.
Note that sometimes hemorrhoids (swollen veins in the anal area) can mimic the pain, discomfort, and bleeding seen with anal-rectal cancers. Individuals who have the above symptoms should get a medical exam of their anal-rectal area to be sure they have an accurate diagnosis","Rectal cancer usually develops over several years, first growing as a precancerous growth called a polyp. Some polyps have the ability to turn into cancer and begin to grow and penetrate the wall of the rectum. The actual cause of rectal cancer is unclear. However, the following are risk factors for developing rectal cancer:

Increasing age
Smoking
Family history of colon or rectal cancer
High-fat diet and/or a diet mostly from animal sources (a diet usually found in developed countries such as the United States)
Personal or family history of polyps or colorectal cancer
Inflammatory bowel disease
Family history is a factor in determining the risk of rectal cancer. If a family history of colorectal cancer is present in a first-degree relative (a parent or a sibling), then endoscopy of the colon and rectum should begin 10 years before the age of the relative's diagnosis or at age 50 years, whichever comes first. An often forgotten risk factor, but perhaps the most important, is the lack of screening for rectal cancer. Routine cancer screening of the colon and rectum is the best way to prevent rectal cancer. Genetics may play a role as Lynch syndrome, an inherited disorder also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or HNPCC, increases the risk of many cancers, including rectal. Although human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are more related to anal cancer and squamous cell cancers around the anus and anal canal, some studies show that they can also be related to rectal cancer. Because some rectal cancers may be associated with HPV infections, it may be possible that HPV vaccination could reduce the chance of getting some rectal cancers","Appropriate colorectal screening leading to the detection and removal of precancerous growths is the only way to prevent this disease. Screening tests for rectal cancer include the following:

Fecal occult blood test (FOBT) or fecal immunochemical tests (FIT): Early rectal cancer may damage blood vessels of the rectal lining and cause small amounts of blood to leak into the feces. The stool appearance may not change. The fecal occult blood test requires placing a small amount of stool on a special paper that is provided by a doctor. The doctor then applies a chemical to that paper to see if blood is present in the stool sample. Statistics suggest the tests are 95% accurate (positive) in patients with rectal cancer. However, the test may also be positive in some benign conditions as well.
Endoscopy: During endoscopy, a doctor inserts a flexible tube with a camera at the end (called an endoscope) through the anus and into the rectum and colon. During this procedure, the doctor can see and remove abnormalities on the inner lining of the colon and rectum.
If rectal cancer is suspected, the tumor can be physically detected through either digital rectal examination (DRE) or endoscopy.

A digital rectal examination is performed by a doctor using a lubricated gloved finger inserted through the anus to feel the cancer on the rectal wall. Not all rectal cancers can be felt this way, and detection is dependent on how far the tumor is from the anus. If an abnormality is detected by a digital rectal examination, then an endoscopy is performed for further evaluation of the cancer.
Flexible sigmoidoscopy is the insertion of a flexible tube with a camera on the end (called an endoscope) through the anus and into the rectum. An endoscope allows a doctor to see the entire rectum, including the lining of the rectal wall.
Rigid sigmoidoscopy is the insertion of a rigid optical scope inserted through the anus and into the rectum. Rigid sigmoidoscopy is usually performed by either a gastroenterologist or a surgeon. The advantage of rigid sigmoidoscopy is that a more exact measurement of the tumor's distance from the anus can be obtained, which may be relevant if surgery is required.
A colonoscopy may be performed. For a colonoscopy, a flexible endoscope is inserted through the anus and into the rectum and colon. A colonoscopy allows a doctor to see abnormalities in the entire colon, including the rectum.
Because the depth of the cancer's growth into the rectal wall is important in determining treatment, an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) may be performed during endoscopy. An endoscopic ultrasound uses an ultrasound probe at the tip of an endoscope that allows a doctor to see how deeply the cancer has penetrated. In addition, a doctor can measure the size of the lymph nodes around the rectum during an endoscopic ultrasound. Based on the size of the lymph nodes, a good prediction can be made as to whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. Once an abnormality is seen with endoscopy, a biopsy specimen is obtained using the endoscope and sent to a pathologist. The pathologist can confirm that the abnormality is a cancer and needs treatment. A person may experience small amounts of bleeding after a biopsy is performed. If this bleeding is heavy or lasts longer than a few days, a doctor should be notified immediately. A chest X-ray and a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis are most likely performed to see whether the cancer has spread further than the rectum or surrounding lymph nodes. MRI is also used to determine the extent of spread of the cancer.

Routine blood studies (for example, CBC, liver function tests, B-12 levels) are performed to assess how a person might tolerate the upcoming treatment.

In addition, a blood test called CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) is obtained. CEA is often produced by colorectal cancers and can be a useful gauge of how the treatment is working. After the treatment, the doctor may regularly check the CEA level as one indicator of whether the cancer has returned. However, checking the CEA level is not an absolute test for colorectal cancers, and other conditions may cause a rise in the CEA level. Likewise, a normal CEA level is not a guarantee that the cancer is no longer present. Also, a cancer antigen (CA) 19-9 assay may be used to monitor the disease.","Surgery is likely to be the only necessary step in treatment if stage I rectal cancer is diagnosed.

The risk of the cancer coming back after surgery is low, and therefore, chemotherapy is not usually offered. Sometimes, after the removal of a tumor, the doctor discovers that the tumor penetrated into the mesorectum (stage II) or that the lymph nodes contained cancer cells (stage III). In these individuals, chemotherapy and radiation therapy are offered after recovery from the surgery to reduce the chance of the cancer returning. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy given after surgery is called adjuvant therapy.

If the initial exams and tests show a person to have stage II or III rectal cancer, then chemotherapy and radiation therapy should be considered before surgery. Chemotherapy and radiation given before surgery is called neoadjuvant therapy. This therapy lasts approximately six weeks. Neoadjuvant therapy is performed to shrink the tumor so it can be more completely removed by surgery. In addition, a person is likely to tolerate the side effects of combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy better if this therapy is administered before surgery rather than afterward. After recovery from the surgery, a person who has undergone neoadjuvant therapy should meet with the oncologist to discuss the need for more chemotherapy. If the rectal cancer is metastatic, then surgery and radiation therapy would only be performed if persistent bleeding or bowel obstruction from the rectal mass exist. Otherwise, chemotherapy alone is the standard treatment of metastatic rectal cancer. At this time, metastatic rectal cancer is not curable. However, average survival times for people with metastatic rectal cancer have lengthened over the past several years because of the introduction of new medications.",https://www.emedicinehealth.com/rectal_cancer/article_em.htm
