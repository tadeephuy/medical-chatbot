       "['Dizzy spells are extremely difficult to figure out especially when they clear up in a few minutes. There can be an episode of wooziness when the brain just doesn t feel right. There can be bouts of spinning vertigo with nausea and vomiting. A spell of lightheadedness, or vertigo, is usually not a stroke. There are many causes of vertigo: viral infection, an unusual form of migraine, even a benign condition that results in vertigo when you rise up from bed or move your head in certain ways.',\n",
       " 'But stroke is one of the causes of room spinning vertigo, too. How do you know if that dizzy spell you just had is a sign of a transient stroke? Strokecaused vertigo is often associated with other symptoms, including numbness or weakness on the side of the face, a droopy eyelid, or double vision. 09 572016 ch04.qxd 8/3/05 6:48 PM Page 76 76 Part II: Types of Stroke Sometimes dizziness caused by a stroke can be associated with clumsiness or weakness of the hand. Likewise, you might have difficulty with balance while you are walking or staggering, as the case may be supporting yourself against tables and chairs.',\n",
       " 'Age is another indicator of whether your dizziness is likely to be stroke related. A dizzy episode when you are 33 is probably not a stroke in progress. (It s not impossible, though, especially if you are taking birth control pills and smoking cigarettes.) If you are 67, stroke is a more likely culprit particularly if you also have high blood pressure, diabetes, and a history of heart trouble.']"
