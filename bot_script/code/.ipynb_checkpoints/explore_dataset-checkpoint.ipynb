       "[\"Thalassemia is caused by mutations in the DNA of cells that make hemoglobin — the substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout your body. The mutations associated with thalassemia are passed from parents to children.\\n\\nHemoglobin molecules are made of chains called alpha and beta chains that can be affected by mutations. In thalassemia, the production of either the alpha or beta chains are reduced, resulting in either alpha-thalassemia or beta-thalassemia.\\n\\nIn alpha-thalassemia, the severity of thalassemia you have depends on the number of gene mutations you inherit from your parents. The more mutated genes, the more severe your thalassemia.\\n\\nIn beta-thalassemia, the severity of thalassemia you have depends on which part of the hemoglobin molecule is affected.\\n\\nAlpha-thalassemia\\nFour genes are involved in making the alpha hemoglobin chain. You get two from each of your parents. If you inherit:\\n\\nOne mutated gene, you'll have no signs or symptoms of thalassemia. But you are a carrier of the disease and can pass it on to your children.\\nTwo mutated genes, your thalassemia signs and symptoms will be mild. This condition might be called alpha-thalassemia trait.\\nThree mutated genes, your signs and symptoms will be moderate to severe.\\nInheriting four mutated genes is rare and usually results in stillbirth. Babies born with this condition often die shortly after birth or require lifelong transfusion therapy. In rare cases, a child born with this condition can be treated with transfusions and a stem cell transplant.\\n\\nBeta-thalassemia\\nTwo genes are involved in making the beta hemoglobin chain. You get one from each of your parents. If you inherit:\\n\\nOne mutated gene, you'll have mild signs and symptoms. This condition is called thalassemia minor or beta-thalassemia.\\nTwo mutated genes, your signs and symptoms will be moderate to severe. This condition is called thalassemia major, or Cooley anemia.\\n\\nBabies born with two defective beta hemoglobin genes usually are healthy at birth but develop signs and symptoms within the first two years of life. A milder form, called thalassemia intermedia, also can result from two mutated genes.Factors that increase your risk of thalassemia include:\\n\\nFamily history of thalassemia. Thalassemia is passed from parents to children through mutated hemoglobin genes.\\nCertain ancestry. Thalassemia occurs most often in African Americans and in people of Mediterranean and Southeast Asian descent.\",\n",
       " 'Thalassemia occurs when there’s an abnormality or mutation in one of the genes involved in hemoglobin production. You inherit this genetic abnormality from your parents.\\n\\nIf only one of your parents is a carrier for thalassemia, you may develop a form of the disease known as thalassemia minor. If this occurs, you probably won’t have symptoms, but you’ll be a carrier. Some people with thalassemia minor do develop minor symptoms.\\n\\nIf both of your parents are carriers of thalassemia, you have a greater chance of inheriting a more serious form of the disease.\\n\\nThalassemia is most commonTrusted Source in people from Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Mediterranean countries such as Greece and Turkey',\n",
       " 'Thalassemia is genetic. It happens when you inherit mutated genes from your parents that change your hemoglobin. You have it from birth. You can’t catch thalassemia the way you catch a cold or the flu.\\n\\nIf both of your parents carry thalassemia, you might get it. If you inherit two or more copies of abnormal genes from your parents, you may get mild to severe thalassemia, depending on what type of protein is affected. It’s more common in people from Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Mediterranean countries like Greece or Turkey',\n",
       " 'The protein hemoglobin transports oxygen around the body in blood cells. Bone marrow uses the iron we get from food to make hemoglobin.\\n\\nIn people with thalassemia, the bone marrow does not produce enough healthy hemoglobin or red blood cells. In some types this leads to a lack of oxygen, resulting in anemia and fatigue.\\n\\nPeople with mild thalassemia may not require any treatment, but more severe forms will necessitate regular blood transfusions.',\n",
       " \"Thalassaemia is caused by faulty genes that affect the production of haemoglobin.\\n\\nA child can only be born with thalassaemia if they inherit these faulty genes from both parents.\\n\\nFor example, if both parents have the faulty gene that causes beta thalassaemia major, there's a 1 in 4 chance of each child they have being born with the condition.\\n\\nThe parents of a child with thalassaemia are usually carriers. This means they only have 1 of the faulty genes.\"]"

       "'Liver cancer is cancer that begins in the cells of your liver. Your liver is a football-sized organ that sits in the upper right portion of your abdomen, beneath your diaphragm and above your stomach.\\n\\nSeveral types of cancer can form in the liver. The most common type of liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma, which begins in the main type of liver cell (hepatocyte). Other types of liver cancer, such as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and hepatoblastoma, are much less common.\\n\\nCancer that spreads to the liver is more common than cancer that begins in the liver cells. Cancer that begins in another area of the body — such as the colon, lung or breast — and then spreads to the liver is called metastatic cancer rather than liver cancer. This type of cancer is named after the organ in which it began — such as metastatic colon cancer to describe cancer that begins in the colon and spreads to the liver.'"
