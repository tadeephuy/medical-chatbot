1,"Thalassemia (thal-uh-SEE-me-uh) is an inherited blood disorder that causes your body to have less hemoglobin than normal. Hemoglobin enables red blood cells to carry oxygen. Thalassemia can cause anemia, leaving you fatigued.

If you have mild thalassemia, you might not need treatment. But more severe forms might require regular blood transfusions. You can take steps to cope with fatigue, such as choosing a healthy diet and exercising regularly","There are several types of thalassemia. The signs and symptoms you have depend on the type and severity of your condition.

Thalassemia signs and symptoms can include:

Fatigue
Weakness
Pale or yellowish skin
Facial bone deformities
Slow growth
Abdominal swelling
Dark urine
Some babies show signs and symptoms of thalassemia at birth; others develop them during the first two years of life. Some people who have only one affected hemoglobin gene don't have thalassemia symptoms","Thalassemia is caused by mutations in the DNA of cells that make hemoglobin — the substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout your body. The mutations associated with thalassemia are passed from parents to children.

Hemoglobin molecules are made of chains called alpha and beta chains that can be affected by mutations. In thalassemia, the production of either the alpha or beta chains are reduced, resulting in either alpha-thalassemia or beta-thalassemia.

In alpha-thalassemia, the severity of thalassemia you have depends on the number of gene mutations you inherit from your parents. The more mutated genes, the more severe your thalassemia.

In beta-thalassemia, the severity of thalassemia you have depends on which part of the hemoglobin molecule is affected.

Alpha-thalassemia
Four genes are involved in making the alpha hemoglobin chain. You get two from each of your parents. If you inherit:

One mutated gene, you'll have no signs or symptoms of thalassemia. But you are a carrier of the disease and can pass it on to your children.
Two mutated genes, your thalassemia signs and symptoms will be mild. This condition might be called alpha-thalassemia trait.
Three mutated genes, your signs and symptoms will be moderate to severe.
Inheriting four mutated genes is rare and usually results in stillbirth. Babies born with this condition often die shortly after birth or require lifelong transfusion therapy. In rare cases, a child born with this condition can be treated with transfusions and a stem cell transplant.

Beta-thalassemia
Two genes are involved in making the beta hemoglobin chain. You get one from each of your parents. If you inherit:

One mutated gene, you'll have mild signs and symptoms. This condition is called thalassemia minor or beta-thalassemia.
Two mutated genes, your signs and symptoms will be moderate to severe. This condition is called thalassemia major, or Cooley anemia.

Babies born with two defective beta hemoglobin genes usually are healthy at birth but develop signs and symptoms within the first two years of life. A milder form, called thalassemia intermedia, also can result from two mutated genes.Factors that increase your risk of thalassemia include:

Family history of thalassemia. Thalassemia is passed from parents to children through mutated hemoglobin genes.
Certain ancestry. Thalassemia occurs most often in African Americans and in people of Mediterranean and Southeast Asian descent.","Most children with moderate to severe thalassemia show signs and symptoms within their first two years of life. If your doctor suspects your child has thalassemia, he or she can confirm a diagnosis with blood tests.

Blood tests can reveal the number of red blood cells and abnormalities in size, shape or color. Blood tests can also be used for DNA analysis to look for mutated genes.

Prenatal testing
Testing can be done before a baby is born to find out if he or she has thalassemia and determine how severe it might be. Tests used to diagnose thalassemia in fetuses include:

Chorionic villus sampling. Usually done around the 11th week of pregnancy, this test involves removing a tiny piece of the placenta for evaluation.
Amniocentesis. Usually done around the 16th week of pregnancy, this test involves examining a sample of the fluid that surrounds the fetus.","Mild forms of thalassemia trait don't need treatment.

For moderate to severe thalassemia, treatments might include:

Frequent blood transfusions. More severe forms of thalassemia often require frequent blood transfusions, possibly every few weeks. Over time, blood transfusions cause a buildup of iron in your blood, which can damage your heart, liver and other organs.
Chelation therapy. This is treatment to remove excess iron from your blood. Iron can build up as a result of regular transfusions. Some people with thalassemia who don't have regular transfusions can also develop excess iron. Removing the excess iron is vital for your health.

To help rid your body of the extra iron, you might need to take an oral medication, such as deferasirox (Exjade, Jadenu) or deferiprone (Ferriprox). Another drug, deferoxamine (Desferal), is given by needle.

Stem cell transplant. Also called a bone marrow transplant, a stem cell transplant might be an option in some cases. For children with severe thalassemia, it can eliminate the need for lifelong blood transfusions and drugs to control iron overload.

This procedure involves receiving infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor, usually a sibling.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thalassemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354995
2,"Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder in which the body makes an abnormal form of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen.

The disorder results in excessive destruction of red blood cells, which leads to anemia. Anemia is a condition in which your body doesn’t have enough normal, healthy red blood cells.

Thalassemia is inherited, meaning that at least one of your parents must be a carrier of the disorder. It’s caused by either a genetic mutation or a deletion of certain key gene fragments.

Thalassemia minor is a less serious form of the disorder. There are two main forms of thalassemia that are more serious. In alpha thalassemia, at least one of the alpha globin genes has a mutation or abnormality. In beta thalassemia, the beta globin genes are affected.

Each of these forms of thalassemia has different subtypes. The exact form you have will affect the severity of your symptoms and your outlook.","The symptoms of thalassemia can vary. Some of the most common ones include:

bone deformities, especially in the face
dark urine
delayed growth and development
excessive tiredness and fatigue
yellow or pale skin
Not everyone has visible symptoms of thalassemia. Signs of the disorder also tend to show up later in childhood or adolescence","Thalassemia occurs when there’s an abnormality or mutation in one of the genes involved in hemoglobin production. You inherit this genetic abnormality from your parents.

If only one of your parents is a carrier for thalassemia, you may develop a form of the disease known as thalassemia minor. If this occurs, you probably won’t have symptoms, but you’ll be a carrier. Some people with thalassemia minor do develop minor symptoms.

If both of your parents are carriers of thalassemia, you have a greater chance of inheriting a more serious form of the disease.

Thalassemia is most commonTrusted Source in people from Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Mediterranean countries such as Greece and Turkey","If your doctor is trying to diagnose thalassemia, they’ll likely take a blood sample. They’ll send this sample to a lab to be tested for anemia and abnormal hemoglobin. A lab technician will also look at the blood under a microscope to see if the red blood cells are oddly shaped.

Abnormally shaped red blood cells are a sign of thalassemia. The lab technician may also perform a test known as hemoglobin electrophoresis. This test separates out the different molecules in the red blood cells, allowing them to identify the abnormal type.

Depending on the type and severity of the thalassemia, a physical examination might also help your doctor make a diagnosis. For example, a severely enlarged spleen might suggest to your doctor that you have hemoglobin H disease","The treatment for thalassemia depends on the type and severity of disease involved. Your doctor will give you a course of treatment that will work best for your particular case.

Some of the treatments include:

blood transfusions
bone marrow transplant
medications and supplements
possible surgery to remove the spleen or gallbladder
Your doctor may instruct you not to take vitamins or supplements containing iron. This is especially true if you need blood transfusions because people who receive them accumulate extra iron that the body can’t easily get rid of. Iron can build up in tissues, which can be potentially fatal.

If you’re receiving a blood transfusion, you may also need chelation therapy. This generally involves receiving an injection of a chemical that binds with iron and other heavy metals. This helps remove extra iron from your body.",https://www.healthline.com/health/thalassemia#in-pregnancy
3,"Thalassemia is an inherited blood condition. If you have it, your body has fewer red blood cells and less hemoglobin than it should. Hemoglobin is important because it lets your red blood cells carry oxygen to all parts of your body. Because of this, people with this condition may have anemia, which makes you feel tired.

You may hear it called things like Constant Spring, Cooley’s anemia, or hemoglobin Bart’s hydrops fetalis. These are common names for different forms of it. The two types are alpha thalassemia and beta thalassemia. The terms alpha and beta refer to the part of the hemoglobin the person is lacking.

There are also terms for how serious the thalassemia is. A person with a trait or minor form may not have symptoms or only mild ones. They may not need treatment. Someone with a major form will need medical treatment.","These can include:

Slow growth in children
Wide or brittle bones
Enlarged spleen (an organ in your abdomen that filters blood and fights disease)
Fatigue
Weakness
Pale or yellow skin
Dark urine
Poor appetite
Heart problems
In some people, symptoms show up at birth. In others, it can take a couple of years to see anything. Some people who have thalassemia will show no signs at all","Thalassemia is genetic. It happens when you inherit mutated genes from your parents that change your hemoglobin. You have it from birth. You can’t catch thalassemia the way you catch a cold or the flu.

If both of your parents carry thalassemia, you might get it. If you inherit two or more copies of abnormal genes from your parents, you may get mild to severe thalassemia, depending on what type of protein is affected. It’s more common in people from Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Mediterranean countries like Greece or Turkey","If you think you may have thalassemia, or if your parents have it, you should see a doctor. They will examine you and will ask questions. Children with moderate to severe thalassemia usually have signs by age 2.

If a doctor suspects thalassemia, you’ll take blood tests. One is a CBC (complete blood count) test. The other is a hemoglobin electrophoresis test.

If you are pregnant or trying to have a baby, you can have tests to learn if your baby will have the condition.

Genetic testing can show if you or your partner carries any of the genes that cause thalassemia.
Chorionic villus sampling tests a tiny piece of the placenta to see if a baby has the genes that cause thalassemia. Doctors usually do this test around the 11th week of pregnancy.
Amniocentesis tests the fluid around an unborn baby. Doctors usually do this test around the 16th week of pregnancy.
If you do have thalassemia, you should see a blood expert known as a hematologist. You may also need other special doctors on your team, like those who treat the heart or liver.","If you have thalassemia, follow these habits to stay well:

Eat a healthy diet to keep your bones strong and give you energy.
If you get a fever or feel ill, see your doctor.
Stay away from sick people and wash your hands often.
Ask your doctor about supplements like calcium and vitamin D.
Don’t take iron pills.
With a mild case, you may feel tired and not need treatment. But if it’s more serious, your organs may not get the oxygen they need. Treatment might include:

Blood transfusions. A transfusion is a way to get donated blood or parts of blood that your body needs, like hemoglobin. How often you need transfusions can vary. Some people have one every few weeks. Your transfusion schedule may change as you get older.
Chelation therapy. Blood transfusions are important for people with thalassemia. But they can cause too much iron in the blood. That can lead to problems with the heart, liver, and blood sugar. If you get transfusions, you and your doctor will talk about whether you need medicine that can help remove extra iron from your body.
Stem cell or bone marrow transplant. An infusion of stem cells from a matched donor can sometimes cure thalassemia.
Supplements. In some cases, your doctor might recommend that you take extra folic acid or other supplements.
Surgery. Some people with thalassemia may need their spleen removed",https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-thalassemia
4,"Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder that affects the body’s ability to produce hemoglobin and red blood cells.

A person with thalassemia will have too few red blood cells and too little hemoglobin, and the red blood cells may be too small.

The impact can range from mild to severe and life-threatening.

Around 100,000 newborns are delivered each year with severe forms of thalassemia. It is most common with Mediterranean, South Asian, and African ancestry","The symptoms of thalassemia vary depending on the type of thalassemia.

Symptoms will not show until the age of 6 months in most infants with beta thalassemia and some types of alpha thalassemia. This is because neonates have a different type of hemoglobin, called fetal hemoglobin.

After 6 months “normal” hemoglobin starts replacing the fetal type, and symptoms may begin to appear.

These include:

jaundice and pale skin
drowsiness and fatigue
chest pain
cold hands and feet
shortness of breath
leg cramps
rapid heart beat
poor feeding
delayed growth
headaches
dizziness and faintness
greater susceptibility to infections
Skeletal deformities may result as the body tries to produce more bone marrow.

If there is too much iron, the body will try to absorb more iron to compensate. Iron may also accumulate from blood transfusions. Excessive iron can harm the spleen, heart, and liver.

Patients with hemoglobin H are more likely to develop gallstones and an enlarged spleen.

Untreated, the complications of thalassemia can lead to organ failure.","The protein hemoglobin transports oxygen around the body in blood cells. Bone marrow uses the iron we get from food to make hemoglobin.

In people with thalassemia, the bone marrow does not produce enough healthy hemoglobin or red blood cells. In some types this leads to a lack of oxygen, resulting in anemia and fatigue.

People with mild thalassemia may not require any treatment, but more severe forms will necessitate regular blood transfusions.","Most children with moderate to severe thalassemia receive a diagnosis by the time they are 2 years old.

People with no symptoms may not realize that they are carriers until they have a child with thalassemia.

Blood tests can detect if a person is a carrier or if they have thalassemia.

A complete blood count (CBC): This can check levels of hemoglobin and the level and size of red blood cells.

A reticulocyte count: This measures how fast red blood cells, or reticulocytes, are produced and released by the bone marrow. Reticulocytes usually spend around 2 days in the bloodstream before developing into mature red blood cells. Between 1 and 2 percent of a healthy person’s red blood cells are reticulocytes.

Iron: This will help the doctor determine the cause of anemia, whether thalassemia or iron deficiency. In thalassemia, iron deficiency is not the cause.

Genetic testing: DNA analysis will show whether a person has thalassemia or faulty genes.

Prenatal testing: This can show whether a fetus has thalassemia, and how severe it might be.

Chorionic villus sampling (CVS): a piece of placenta is removed for testing, usually around the 11th week of pregnancy.
Amniocentesis: a small sample of amniotic fluid is taken for testing, usually during the 16th week of pregnancy. Amniotic fluid is the fluid that surrounds the fetus","Blood transfusions: These can replenish hemoglobin and red blood cell levels. Patients with thalassemia major will need between eight and twelve transfusions a year. Those with less severe thalassemia will need up to eight transfusions each year, or more in times of stress, illness, or infection.

Iron chelation: This involves removing excess iron from the bloodstream. Sometimes blood transfusions can cause iron overload. This can damage the heart and other organs. Patients may be prescribed deferoxamine, a medication that is injected under the skin, or deferasirox, taken by mouth.

Patients who receive blood transfusions and chelation may also need folic acid supplements. These help the red blood cells develop.

Bone marrow, or stem cell, transplant: Bone marrow cells produce red and white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets. A transplant from a compatible donor may be an effective treatment, in severe cases.

Surgery: This may be necessary to correct bone abnormalities.

Gene therapy: Scientists are investigating genetic techniques to treat thalassemia. Possibilities include inserting a normal beta-globin gene into the patient’s bone marrow, or using drugs to reactivate the genes that produce fetal hemoglobin.",https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/263489
5,"Thalassaemia is the name for a group of inherited conditions that affect a substance in the blood called haemoglobin.

People with thalassaemia produce either no or too little haemoglobin, which is used by red blood cells to carry oxygen around the body.

This can make them very anaemic (tired, short of breath and pale).

It mainly affects people of Mediterranean, south Asian, southeast Asian and Middle Eastern origin.

There are different types of thalassaemia, which can be divided into alpha and beta thalassaemias. Beta thalassaemia major is the most severe type.

Other types include beta thalassaemia intermedia, alpha thalassaemia major and haemoglobin H disease.

It's also possible to be a ""carrier"" of thalassaemia, also known as having the thalassaemia trait.

Being a beta thalassaemia carrier will not generally cause you any health problems, but you're at risk of having children with thalassaemia.","Most people born with thalassaemia experience health problems from a few months after birth.

Less severe cases may not be noticeable until later in childhood or even until adulthood.

The main health problems associated with thalassaemia are:

anaemia – severe tiredness, weakness, shortness of breath, pounding, fluttering or irregular heartbeats (palpitations) and pale skin caused by the lack of haemoglobin
too much iron in the body – this is caused by the regular blood transfusions used to treat anaemia and can cause problems with the heart, liver and hormone levels if untreated
Some people may also have delayed growth, weak and fragile bones (osteoporosis), and reduced fertility.","Thalassaemia is caused by faulty genes that affect the production of haemoglobin.

A child can only be born with thalassaemia if they inherit these faulty genes from both parents.

For example, if both parents have the faulty gene that causes beta thalassaemia major, there's a 1 in 4 chance of each child they have being born with the condition.

The parents of a child with thalassaemia are usually carriers. This means they only have 1 of the faulty genes.","Thalassaemia is often detected during pregnancy or soon after birth.

Screening for thalassaemia in pregnancy is offered to all pregnant women in England to check if there's a risk of a child being born with the condition, and some types may be picked up during the newborn blood spot test (heel prick test).

Blood tests can also be carried out at any age to check for thalassaemia or to see if you're a carrier of a faulty gene that causes it","People with thalassaemia major or other serious types will need specialist care throughout their lives.

The main treatments are:

blood transfusions – regular blood transfusions treat and prevent anaemia; in severe cases these are needed around once a month
chelation therapy – treatment with medicine to remove the excess iron from the body that builds up as a result of having regular blood transfusions; some people with thalassaemia get a build-up of iron even without transfusions and need treatment for this
Eating a healthy diet, doing regular exercise and not smoking or drinking too much alcohol can also help you stay as healthy as possible.

The only possible cure for thalassaemia is a stem cell or bone marrow transplant, but this is not done very often because of the risks involved.",https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/thalassaemia/
